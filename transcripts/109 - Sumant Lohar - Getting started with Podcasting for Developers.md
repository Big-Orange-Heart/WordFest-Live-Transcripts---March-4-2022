**Lax Mariappan:** So, but 

**Sumant Lohar:** Namaste a warm welcome to all of you to this amazing session for today. Today, we are going to talk about getting started with [00:04:00] podcasting for developers. And I'm Sumant your company, and we'll take you through the entire process of starting your own podcast, even if you are a developer. So let's get started.

**Sumant Lohar:** I spent, you know, least time on introduction because more than introduction, the main area is to learn about podcasting. So basically I'm a tech blogger or content and social media strategist, video content creator, which had a speaker at various. Podcaster at the idea. Well, content, so I so I Sumant Lohar now welcome to this amazing session.

**Sumant Lohar:** So here are some of the amazing, you know, agent for today, and we are going to see one by one, all of them and explore all the opportunities. What is the first thought that comes to mind while we are starting with podcast. So I got this first amazing and [00:05:00] inspiring thought from Pat Flynn, who is a well-known podcaster.

**Sumant Lohar:** He sees that the riches are in the niches friends. You all are almost, I assume that in this. Working as a developer or maybe a designer and a CSS, a specialist, a blogger, or a marketer. So if you see that, the way you focus on one niche, you get, you know, grow, growing and growing. So the way you are, you know, making it a statement, it says the riches are in the niche.

**Sumant Lohar:** So if you just stick to one or two niche, you can be rich the way you want it. Okay, now let's get into the basics of the podcasting first. Let's say a first history. You know that from our forefathers, we have been listening that they used to, uh, listen to all the audio part through gramophone. And then we came with her [00:06:00] antique radio then came tape recorder.

**Sumant Lohar:** Sony Walkman, which we used to put in our ear and take it everywhere, video audio castte, and then can be apple iPod MP3 players, where you can store 300 more than 300 songs. Right. But all of this was replaced by a smartphone where you can do multiple things, audio, video, social media, marketing, you know, messaging everything.

**Sumant Lohar:** So what is the definition of. Podcast is an audio format available on different distribution platforms, which is downloadable that makes it convenient for the people to listen to them while traveling for other activity hours, daily workouts, or while relaxing at home. This can be published on website.

**Sumant Lohar:** YouTube social media platforms. So it's something that you can download them from the various distribution platforms. These are not the social media platforms. These are the platforms like [00:07:00] Spotify, Google podcasts, and those where they can download them and listen at your own convenience. So. What is the importance of podcasting?

**Sumant Lohar:** It is usually in a series of podcasts. So you, how, like, for example, if we are talking about, let's say Gutenberg editor, so it takes into different series, like one to 10 and then 10 to 20. Okay. Again, you can have the variations and do that different podcast. Now this few points are very much, uh, of importance, right?

**Sumant Lohar:** It is a niche based. So if you have forecasting generalized away, maybe you get an audience at a lesser pace. But if we are focusing on, let's say you are a tech, but that person. Focus on tech tech things. If you are, you know, related to fashion industry folk focus on fashion industry. So that's how you slowly, slowly grow in this area.

**Sumant Lohar:** It gives you [00:08:00] immersive experience while listening, you know, you, while you are listening to each podcast, you have the combination of audio, uh, you know, the sound effects the voice off a broadcaster. So that gives a very soothing effect, that relaxing effect, where you can listen to them any. It's a conversational, it's not a, you know, very serious matter or something which, uh, makes you, uh, that you are to concentrate on that time.

**Sumant Lohar:** It's a conversational, it's a casual form of delivering content. Now next, no barriers for listening. You can listen to them while walking, running, traveling, eating, or even relaxing, right. Everyone enjoying with friends as well, access them for free. What does this mean? All of the podcast, genders today are available for free.

**Sumant Lohar:** Of course you can listen to them, but there are some premium channels as well, where you have to subscribe on a monthly basis or yearly basis, and you can [00:09:00] listen to them. That's what we call about as a membership right now. What is the punchline of podcast? It's the new normal for travelers and commuters.

**Sumant Lohar:** If you are traveling to any part of the world, so you can listen to what. If you are a commuter commuter means from home to your workplace or somewhere where you're going for a job or you're going for your business or something, that's how you travel. And you listen to podcasts, you know, utilizing that precious.

**Sumant Lohar:** Next, this is very important. You can take the screenshot of this because, uh, you know, when we talk about podcast, so you need to be very clear with what type of podcast you want to start with. So we have solo, solo, or monologue, that means you alone right now, while I'm talking to you, that's a solo thing.

**Sumant Lohar:** So that means you can range from 15 to 20 minutes [00:10:00] each episode, and you can publish three to four episodes that depends on your expertise, your time, convenience, and the way you want to deliver it. Second is host and co-host, you may be seeing in this particular word, WordPress, because that makes you very. Uh, you know, you can relate with that.

**Sumant Lohar:** You see that there is a host and there's a cohost. So when their conversation and they're introducing to a new guest, so that's how it's a host and co-host part. And that, uh, you know, ranges from 20 to 25 minutes, you can publish weekly two to three episodes, right? Interview you, you invite. Within your industry, like, let's say you are a developer WordPress developer, and you invite someone else, uh, you know, WordPress developer from another company and you gain to, uh, ask them different questions around their methodology, what challenges they face and what are the tools they use.

**Sumant Lohar:** So [00:11:00] that's how you make it more impactful and influential. So that ranges from 35 to 45. And at least you can, uh, publish one to two episodes per week panel discussion. If you have people around, let's say a two or three or four guest for your podcast, you can hell around 50 to 75 minutes of each episode and you can publish one episode of.

**Sumant Lohar:** Storytelling storytelling is, uh, not something like solo stories. So storytelling is something about sharing about the people of others, or you take it something about, uh, you know, considering the, uh, the success stories of others. So in that way, you can, uh, you know, share your thoughts as 15 to 20 minutes range.

**Sumant Lohar:** And weekly three episodes or even two episodes. Last one is a fusion one. Well, this word is given by me. So why I wanted to make it [00:12:00] very, uh, you know, impactful and something that, uh, you know, you can easily remember. So fusion is something. Where you are not sure about whether you want to go for podcast, which is solo or interview, you can do combination of all the above things.

**Sumant Lohar:** So you can have that combination and people will love it. So based on the feedback of the, of your audience slowly you grow, and that's how you make it impactful. And that ranges from 20 to 30 minutes. And depending upon the frequency you can publish on a week basis. Is, this is something very important.

**Sumant Lohar:** Now, here is the real journey that starts for you, right? Is this good time to start podcasting? Yes, definitely. So what is the first step? Now? You are clear that you want to start with podcasting. So what is the first step? Identify your strengths and weaknesses. See friends, you are developer, and when you are starting your journey.

**Sumant Lohar:** But you might [00:13:00] have identify your strengths and weaknesses or what you might have happened that your seniors might have advised you for certain, certain things that you are good at this, you are not good at this. You need to improve at this area. So this is the right time to list down all the things and see for yourself next while you have listed them.

**Sumant Lohar:** What steps you for. What stops you from starting with something new? Always. This is a question around for everyone. When you are starting your new journey for anything, that is something, and that is one barrier for each and every one of us. And that is fear, fear of speaking, fear of running fear of, uh, talking to someone as fear of networking.

**Sumant Lohar:** So this is RD now, what are different types of fear? Let's see the next slide we have fear of exploration. So is that, uh, uh, assembling with you? Expiration means you have everything, but you are [00:14:00] not able to bring up among the people publicly. So this fear you might be having, I'm not saying you are having, you might be having fear of communication.

**Sumant Lohar:** You are good at everything. And sometimes you too, the language barrier sometimes because you have a shyness, you may be having. Uh, fear of communication. You are not able to communicate with people in a very effective manner. That's fine. You just start with something and slowly you can improve that. Fear of public speaking.

**Sumant Lohar:** Now see friends today. I'm able to talk in front of you. It's not just because I, I am, I was expert. I, you know, took this time and learn from different people within the community. So while I'm, uh, you know, learning from the community, I make mistakes and that's how I grew. And today I'm able to speak in front of you without any fear.

**Sumant Lohar:** So you can also identify your fear and you can come out of that knowledge. [00:15:00] You know, friends, uh, sometimes what happens is you have knowledge, but you are not confident whether I should share this publicly or not. So this also fear, uh, you know, sometimes, uh, puts you in a wrong direction. Fear of, let's say.

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, point of view, for example, there is something, uh, on a blog or a statement made by a famous, uh, influencer or developer or someone, and you want to, you know, write something, but you fear what if I write? Or what if I talk about a particular discussion on a podcast or something? So this is how. Fear of planning and execution.

**Sumant Lohar:** You are very good at, you have, you know, decent years of experience as a developer, but you fear to start, uh, planning and executing, uh, each episode, where are you where to start and all those things. Last one is the most important and [00:16:00] most common one fear of ideas. You have everything with you, but you're, uh, you know, figuring out.

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, how to start when to start, what to start and why should I start? So that is also the caution. Like if you are a developer, why should I start? So you will get all the answers in the upcoming slides.

**Sumant Lohar:** How to overcome the fear of speaking. Now you have identified different types of fear. So what is the next one? Networking is the best way that as much as you network with people that you will come to know that you are gaining confidence and that confidence will eventually help you in podcasting. As well, so always network friends, even today.

**Sumant Lohar:** I do not miss out any conferences and I network with lots of people participate in the discussions. So the more you discuss, the more you discuss with [00:17:00] people and that's how you grow. And, you know, you make, uh, your network in a more proper. Grab opportunities to become a speaker at various grant opportunities to become a speaker at various meetups and events.

**Sumant Lohar:** If you are a new one, new, if you are someone who is very shy in sharing publicly. And do not fear, you know, become a speaker and let's make a mistake. It's not something you can give everything in the first shot, right? So slowly, slowly, you grow, listen to various podcasts to understand the flow of delivering a speech right now, you are a developer.

**Sumant Lohar:** So there are lots of people, even within WordPress community who have started their podcast channel. So listen to them and take some inspiration from. Start your watching loud debates. Nonpolitical. Of [00:18:00] course I start your own YouTube channel. Now, here is something very important to note when you are starting with podcast, see friends, uh, it's always better to start with video.

**Sumant Lohar:** Why? Because after all podcasting is all about audio. So the expression of your face. That automatically reflects towards your, you know, this mouth and that comes to the voice. So it's a psychological thing. So always start your YouTube channel and come to the comfort level of speaking to the people through first video, and then starting with audio part frequently share videos on social media platforms about your work progress experience in new learnings.

**Sumant Lohar:** If you are working on a project, let's say, and you, uh, explored a particular functionality or a feature, [00:19:00] but there are a few things that you cannot express, or you cannot talk about publicly. That's fine. But if you come to a challenge or you help solve something, you can share with people and take advantage of that.

**Sumant Lohar:** The more you share with people, the more networks you get, the more leads you generate now. Come out of language barrier, see friends, podcasting is not just about, uh, uh, you're not talking about in just English. You can, if you are, uh, you see today, uh, I'm very fortunate. I feel lucky that I have talking to people around the world and you all are from different regions.

**Sumant Lohar:** You may have different languages. So you start with that language, right. Be comfort in that. And then you can come to English and international level. That's fine. Come out of a language barrier and never look at people when they might make fun of you. When you are starting with your journey, [00:20:00] you know what happens?

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, people make fun of you because you are they mistake now, who does Mr. Because you are taking something action. When you take action, then only you make mistake, right? So that's fine. Be comfortable start working on it and be consistent. Be keep working and keep focusing on yourself. And the last one is be a good listener along with being a good auditor.

**Sumant Lohar:** This is also very important. Now, if I just go on speaking before luck, uh, let's say one hour, two hour, it's not going to help. I also have to listen a lot. So even today, this is a practice that I do when I talk with people and listen to their challenges. First, I, I listened to their introduction first, and then only I start with my introduction that helps me to understand [00:21:00] their perspective.

**Sumant Lohar:** So when I understand their perspective, I can address according to them. So this is a good practice for everyone. Next. Okay. Now you have overcome the fear next. You want to start your podcast. Get that information. That's the important thing. Listen to podcasts. As I said earlier, record your own voice. Now, when you have started a podcast, uh, let's say, uh, your YouTube channel now record your own voice.

**Sumant Lohar:** I'll talk about different tools at the very last. Take feedback from your friends and seniors. Keep consistency in networking consistency in context, that will help you to grow at a, you know, at a very larger level, explore topics, trends, and interests. Don't randomly start podcasting on different topics.

**Sumant Lohar:** No learn out, identify topics on which you are comfortable. Identify times I did have [00:22:00] a interest of the audience. For example, you are, uh, on, let's say on Twitter and you have 1000 followers with you. So do not just, uh, uh, start with something that I'm going to start hell you know, their feedback, what they are interested in, learn about their interests and then start your journey.

**Sumant Lohar:** So now, Are you excited to start a new journey for podcast? Yes. Now next few slides are the most important one, so never miss out, you know, keep focusing on this. So what are they the reasons to start now? If I, I have been telling you start your podcast journey, but why you don't need to start, you will have this question in mind, right?

**Sumant Lohar:** So it's a, one of the most preferred form of content. Even if you do not have ability to write blogs, if you do not have the ability to, um, you know, work on your videos, [00:23:00] that's fine. You can start with podcasting. You can listen to anywhere. It's the era of multitasking. What is the meaning of the multitasking?

**Sumant Lohar:** So multitasking doesn't mean that, uh, you do everything at a time. Multitasking means if you are doing some activity less a year, you're working on some coding part and you'll feel bored. So at the same time, you can even listen to a podcast. So like, listen now, Uh, just imagine you are starting your own podcast channel and someone other developer, they want to, uh, get some to podcasts.

**Sumant Lohar:** So they search for you. Okay. This is something that I will do, uh, listen, and also I want to work on. Now that's a, uh, you know, multitask and, uh, they will find it very useful, has lot of potential to generate leads. As I said earlier, forecasting has lot of, uh, you know, uh, potential to generate leads and to make connections, but [00:24:00] it takes a lot of time with team based medium to build a relationship with.

**Sumant Lohar:** Businesses, whether it is agency owners, whether it is enterprises, whether it is it companies or even Browns, they want to invite you, or they want to collaborate with you because you are delivering something very valuable to them. Opportunity to be guest or not. This podcast series see friends, if you want to grow.

**Sumant Lohar:** Okay, that's fine. You are starting your podcast series, but also apparently simultaneously focus on being a guest on different platforms. Uh, and, uh, you know, you do not have to be doing. By yourself slowly and steadily while you share a good, valuable content with them, they will, uh, reach out to you as today.

**Sumant Lohar:** Even today, people reach out to me for, uh, you know, interviewing or for getting, uh, you know, Uh, let's say [00:25:00] published on their articles, like blogs or something. So I hope almost a given my interview on two to three podcast channels. So that's how you grow. You share your address with their guest. Now podcast has just opened up a long way to go.

**Sumant Lohar:** What does this mean? It's not that it's just how awkward, but you have so much to share with people through podcast. And that's where it makes it very unique from different forms of content today, forecasts episodes are available in different languages for various niches market is here. So what's the next.

**Sumant Lohar:** Now you will know that. What are the reasons now, second question that may arise in your mind is should I use website development, team development and plugin development to start with podcasts? Because podcasting has its own process, right? Recording, [00:26:00] editing, and everything. So that does mean that you have to live your, uh, present, uh, uh, you know, business or a job or something.

**Sumant Lohar:** No, you do not have to live that, but in fact, forecasting improves your knowledge. It helps you in personal branding. It has. Gaining confidence, talking to people, the removes fear of public speaking, no one is there to see you. Yeah. When you are recording a voice, no one is there to see you or judge you how you are looking.

**Sumant Lohar:** See it the way you are speaking. No, it's all dependent on your voice. So you have to only work on just one area. And that is what. You have a dead areas. Sound is that, uh, you know, the volume is there. That's different, but you have only one focus that is audio. Part process is easy at first. You might find it very difficult, [00:27:00] but as in V when you progress, it will, uh, you know, uh, look very easy.

**Sumant Lohar:** Abs in business growth. Yeah. If you are doing business, let's say freelancing, if you are doing, or if you are an individual, this helps a lot in your business as well. You scope of various topics to talk about. It's not just about one or two topics. You have a lot of industry you have today in, uh, even in, uh, WordPress community itself.

**Sumant Lohar:** We have so much to talk about. From the perspective of marketing from the perspective of SEO, from the perspective of, uh, let's say, uh, front-end back-end and everything is there, right? So can be a form of giving back to the community. See friends, uh, community is giving us in a lot of different models.

**Sumant Lohar:** But, uh, when we share with people through, uh, podcasting is we share knowledge, we share our experience, we share our challenges and we [00:28:00] invite some of the famous people or some well-known people or people who are working in community day and night, if you invite them. So you see you are in the form of you are giving them back to the community right?

**Sumant Lohar:** Next. What is podcasting for developers? Now we all ready, talked about fear and everything, but actually, what is forecasting for developers? It improves work efficiency. When you collaborate with others or when you take interviews with others or when you, uh, you know, listen to podcast, you get to know a lot of things.

**Sumant Lohar:** You, you, uh, explore different resources, you explore different methods, you explore different, uh, functionality to send fi. Among the WordPress community itself. So this is something very important. Get broader idea about themes, plugins for press lettuce updates, get to know about other developers, their [00:29:00] methodology tools.

**Sumant Lohar:** They use challenges. They have best practices. Stand out from the crowd. You are a developer, you are doing something amazing within the WordPress community. And I believe you all are doing amazing. Not just one person you all are doing with. Uh, something which is a commendable, but if you are starting your podcast journey in the beginning, you might face a lot of challenges.

**Sumant Lohar:** You might, uh, how the fear that's fine, but when you get going with that, You, if people would recognize in that form, that this person is also a developer and a podcaster as well, people will want you to give advices as an expert on their podcast. So they will invite you as an, uh, you know, someone who will, uh, give them advice.

**Sumant Lohar:** For example, I went to give a very simple example, a quick example. Let's say you are in a growing stage. You just started with one or two episodes. [00:30:00] People love to listen to it. And you get the invitation from a, another podcast channel who is having around 10,000 to 15,000 audience regularly watching each episode or listening to them.

**Sumant Lohar:** Now, just see the impact you are giving them. You are going there as a guest, you are sharing your knowledge and the response you get, or people will approach you. It's just unimaginable, right? You can focus in that manner, better visibility among the people down yourself from knowledge equity to knowledge provider right now, while you do not have much knowledge about podcasting.

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, so you are getting knowledge, you know, you're acquiring no. Once you get the steps once, you know, the process of podcasting. And when you share with other people, that's where you become knowledge [00:31:00] provider. So see that transformation from knowledge equator to knowledge provider next. Now this is something very, uh, much of your useful.

**Sumant Lohar:** This is something very useful resources. You can listen to some of this podcast, uh, on, at your convenience. First one is pat Flynn to who even I follow on a regular basis and I are learned so much of things from him. So I highly recommend to learn from scratch. If you don't have. Any of the steps to start with podcasting, you can start listening to pat Flynn.

**Sumant Lohar:** Gary Vernicek, we know is good at branding and different aspects of marketing. Tim Ferris set called in who, uh, he runs like a akimbo or cuss channel. Do the VU from the WordPress community. We have WVU is a to Zed WP coffee talk. The guiding was which. Oh, it's focused on [00:32:00] interviewing, uh, it professionals and other experts from various industries around the world.

**Sumant Lohar:** Post status forecast, your website aging. So these are the, some of the, uh, well-known, uh, forecast. And I think that if you refer them, you'll get to know a lot of things now. This is something of the real formula, or you can say the real ingredient of podcasting. You can take the screenshot of this. I have been working in most of, uh, I have been working on some of the tools and still I'm exploring.

**Sumant Lohar:** So there are some things that. Uh, uh, you know, that keeps changing and even as they change the features functionalities and all those things. So you have recording and editing where you can use garage band and logic pro for Mac or sat, or the Adobe audition for windows. You have zoom and Skype for recording purpose.

**Sumant Lohar:** [00:33:00] You have designing for Canva, Adobe illustrator, Adobe spark Raila, wispy post, a podcast distribution, where you can distribute. Recorded and completed episodes. So these are the, uh, areas where you can start with anchor.fm. Why? Because it allows you to distribute into multiple channels. But, uh, uh, you can also learn to, uh, distribute separately manually, right?

**Sumant Lohar:** You have podcasters streaming platforms where all the podcast episodes will be streamed, uh, for all of your channel. And when you want to get your, uh, you know, sound effects or let's say a background music you can get from the YouTube's audio library, music for content creator, you can search this and you can get that.

**Sumant Lohar:** And the book that the heart of the podcasting planning and execution is mind map. So you can use whimsical or mine. Mister, I use whimsical. Why? [00:34:00] Because it's very simple. You just have to plan out the anti-oppressive. Just think I, you know, uh, how, uh, plan of, uh, exit complete, uh, execution from the scratch level.

**Sumant Lohar:** So it's a like, uh, research work, inviting guest, uh, execution marketing. Distribution editing all episodes, recording all episodes, title, everything. Is there, uh, for me at, uh, mind maps. So use for yourself also slowly, slowly, you know, first, uh, you know, you, uh, create smaller mindmaps and then you. And before I, uh, you know, tell about or share about this monster thought in the end, I would highly recommend when you are recording your voice or you are starting your podcast channel, do not plan to start with 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

**Sumant Lohar:** Always start with two to three minutes because [00:35:00] that's your, your space to grow, to improve. And, uh, to find out that where you are lacking. Because if you are starting for 10, 15 minutes, you have large, huge scope you at right now, you do not need huge scope. You need to take action for forecasting. So this a last thought, something that I want to share with you, good ideas are common, but those who are willing to take action and execute those ideas are far more rare.

**Sumant Lohar:** What does this mean? You have, we all have, uh, ideas which are very common. Who all take action and execute them. Those ideas become rarest thing in today's world. This is again by pat Flynn. Well-known podcaster. So that's it from me. Thank you for your precious time. I highly appreciate your time spending on this particular session.

**Sumant Lohar:** So thank you and namaste from India.[00:36:00] 

**Yogesh Londhe:** I see you here. What did you say? 

**Lax Mariappan:** That that was a good talk. Very encouraging, motivating. And thanks for putting all the, uh, all the questions that a beginner might have answered everything in the slides already. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** So Lax, by the way, in just distracting from the topic that I'm just loving that. You know WordFest, uh, that you get the bite, the music it's very catchy, you know, 24 hours, 60 sessions, one community it's very engaging. And, uh, Sumant mentioned about, uh, finding, uh, copyright free music. Copy, left music in. Yeah. So we've got few questions for someone. Yes. Lax. Uh, you want to go with the first question? 

**Lax Mariappan:** Yeah. So, uh, you know, podcasting [00:37:00] is, um, it's also like, uh, blogging or like there's a lot of competition that are already established podcasts.

**Lax Mariappan:** So how do a developer or someone who's just starting out, make a podcast, stand out. 

**Sumant Lohar:** Yeah. So, as I said earlier, there are so many resources within WordPress community. You can refer them. And apart from that, you can start with just two, two to three episodes and publish on just Audacity. And once you publish that, and when you share with your friends or your, uh, let's say, uh, your companions, companions, and that's how you come to know that where are the areas that you need to improve because at first shot. If you just, uh, go on distributing on different channels, there'll be a little, uh, space for the improvement part.

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay. That's nice. Okay. Um, [00:38:00] now, and I have a question how to promote my podcast. I have made a proud podcast how to promote it. I would do the same thing. I think it's the same question. So we'll go to the next question. Yeah. Well, I will put, put a question to you. Yeah. What kind of debates and podcasts do you listen to? Um, in what languages? 

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, usually I listen to podcasts in a Hindi and English languages, uh, and the debates are around, uh, let's say, uh, the, uh, cross border, uh, discussing. Or maybe let's say around, uh, technology part. We, we have seen that in the recent, uh, just few months we have seen Meta Verse there.

**Sumant Lohar:** And a lot of other technology has come up, but, uh, are we ready for that? So, uh, the experts, uh, talk very nicely with an example, how to be ready with all those [00:39:00] upcoming technologies. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay, so you listen to Hindi and, uh, uh, how so, how about, how about the podcasts in Hindi? Like, is there, uh, English has lot of possible podcasts, but how many podcasts are they in Hindi or Gujarati?, 

**Sumant Lohar:** uh, see uh, compared to of course English is the most, uh, uh, preferred one, but even, uh, as of last three months, if you count so regional languages, uh, podcasts are in demand, huge demand and people are still in fear how to start them. If they start, they will get huge popularity from the beginning itself. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay. Lax, any questions?

**Yogesh Londhe:** We can't hear you, your mic is off. 

**Lax Mariappan:** Okay. So maybe I muted my mic. So, [00:40:00] uh, it's almost the same question. So what do you recommend or what do you, uh, yeah, what do you recommend? Like someone should start broadcasting their language, like in their mother tongue I am from Tamil Nadu. I speak Tamil more fluently, so I should start a podcast in Tamil, or I can try English or like other popular language?

**Sumant Lohar:** Yeah, definitely. Definitely. If you start, uh, broadcasting in mother tongue, you'll be more comfortable, you know, comfortable and even, uh, you know, confident because you know something about your language and if you are starting in English, what will happen is you will first be struggling with the process of podcasting as well as with the language.

**Sumant Lohar:** So this, uh, uh, difference. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay, so you suggest, um, mother tongue podcasts should be, it should take, it should take priority okay. That's good. That's good. Technology podcasts in Tamil or canada would be [00:41:00] amazing. Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Um, Sumant, now. Okay. I'll ask a question. Uh, can you give us the popular, uh, podcasts platforms like people?

**Yogesh Londhe:** What kind of platforms do people listen to sound cloud or, uh, I don't know. 

**Sumant Lohar:** So there are platform platforms, mainly, uh, Spotify is that apple iTunes is there. So these are the two platforms. If any of the podcaster, uh, whether they are new or the existing one, if they focus, they will get a huge popularity in terms of views, in terms of audience, in terms of downloads.

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay. Uh, what about, do you see about this one pocket cast? I, I listened to pocket cast. I dunno. Yeah. I, I like the content there too. Um, is there a way to, [00:42:00] uh, host your audio file somewhere and just let Google do its magic on Google? Because Google has a tool, which a collates podcast from around the web and just gives you, it's not a platform, it's just a tool which lets the.

**Sumant Lohar:** Yeah. So every, every content format has its own SEO, uh, you know, framework. So like if you are using a YouTube SEO, so you have video, uh, uh, part and all those titles and everything in the same. If you are sharing those audio files through this platform, which I told you, so they will help to in, in such also.

**Sumant Lohar:** So, but if you randomly upload somewhere, uh, it might not be recognizable as it should be. Okay. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay. Okay. I got my own opinions on some of the platforms. Yeah, [00:43:00] talk side. We'll listen to your views. Okay. Um, yeah. 

**Lax Mariappan:** So far developers, what are the, some popular podcasts or broadcasters, uh, that you recommend to listen?

**Sumant Lohar:** Uh, yeah, as, as, uh, you know, uh, shared in the slide itself. So there are some, uh, podcasters, like Do The Woo is also there. And we have, uh, I suppose there is some, uh, uh, w Elementor or Yoast or other, uh, areas where you can listen to podcasts and, uh, get updated knowledge from them itself. Yeah. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Lax, do you listen to this podcast distributed?

**Lax Mariappan:** Uh, no, but, uh, I listened to some other WordPress related, like a Post Excerpt from Post Status, uh, WP Minute from 

**Yogesh Londhe:** very nice podcast. It's [00:44:00] not a technology, but it talks a lot about distributed nature of work sometimes.

**Yogesh Londhe:** Uh, the name of the podcast itself is distributed. It's it's started by some, uh, angel investor jazz musician. Okay. Yeah, it sounds interesting. Okay. Okay. So do we have any other questions for, uh, Sumant, Lax?. 

**Lax Mariappan:** Yeah. So, um, I have, uh, some questions like, uh, I mean, can we go with the TLDR version of his talk or something like, uh, yeah.

**Lax Mariappan:** It's like, yeah, you can summarize within another, like, uh, one or two minutes about like most of the challenges, like what people, um, like the common challenges that every. Experience and what should they can [00:45:00] avoid and also how they can monetize are how they can benefit from it. So again, 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Monetize, monetize, yeah, monetize. Yes, that's a good question. 

**Sumant Lohar:** Yeah. So, uh, first thing is, uh, the common challenge that, uh, most of the business face is using the tools because every tool has its own functionality and a different purpose. For example, if you are doing it for you have recorded and, uh, an episode in a zoom or Skype, and then you're taking it for editing.

**Sumant Lohar:** So you edit on audacity for windows and GarageBand on a Mac, but you, how to first learn all the features and everything around that. And then only you can move forward. And at the same time talking about the monetization part. So, uh, say monetization, uh, does not happen, uh, within one or two months. But slowly, when you go with like 25, 30, 40 episodes and you collaborate with [00:46:00] more, more and more, uh, you know, podcasters, you upper, you know, approach them or they invite you as guests.

**Sumant Lohar:** So the collaboration here, the important element is the collaboration. The more collaborations you have, the more audience you have, the, you know, to get better with, uh, the monitorization part. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay, thanks for the tips. So, um, so Sumant there is a question and how to promote podcasts without installing any apps.

**Sumant Lohar:** Yeah. So, uh, without installing any apps, I think, uh, you can, uh, you know, be very active on social media platforms, especially on Instagram and Twitter. Because these are two areas where you can share with people and talk about your podcast or what you are looking at and you have today, uh, Twitter spaces are so there.

**Sumant Lohar:** And a lot of [00:47:00] other things also are there in a line, so you can, uh, share with them. And apart from that, if you want to, you know, promote your podcast channel. So along with the audio part, record them in video part and share. As a video on YouTube channel. 

**Yogesh Londhe:** Okay, great. So thank you very much Sumant. 

**Sumant Lohar:** thank you.
