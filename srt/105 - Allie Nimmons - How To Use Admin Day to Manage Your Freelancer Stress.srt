00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,635

48
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:04,995
Hello?

49
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:05,625
Hello.

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,035
Thank you so much for having me.

51
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:11,355
Uh, my, my, my camera's here and I have
two screens, so I apologize if I'm not

52
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:16,214
making beautiful eye contact with you, but
I'm so happy to be here with you today.

53
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:20,805
Uh, talking about how I use admin day
to manage my stress as a freelancer.

54
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:24,515
Uh, and hopefully there's some things that
you can take away from this presentation.

55
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,575
So I had a beautiful introduction just
now, but just a little bit more about me.

56
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,855
I've been freelancing
for about six years now.

57
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:37,425
Um, I've started a couple of
businesses and I've worked at a

58
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:41,445
couple of businesses, but I think
my primary heart is in freelancing

59
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:42,855
business, owning entrepreneurial.

60
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:43,965
Stuff.

61
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:48,734
Um, and I do struggle like a lot
of us do, especially these days

62
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:51,015
with depression and anxiety.

63
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:58,304
And so I've been really cognizant about
how I can work smarter, not harder

64
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,685
in order to deal with those things.

65
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,640
So this presentation is for you.

66
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,310
If you are a freelancer, a contractor,
or a business owner, anywhere you

67
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,960
fall on that spectrum, um, this
information should be helpful for you.

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,480
If you feel any of these things.

69
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,225
This presentation will be helpful for you.

70
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:28,275
If you're feeling that you have just way
too much to do as you run your business.

71
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:32,625
If you're feeling as though you lack
organization, or you lack the discipline

72
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,015
that you need to get things done, if
you feel like things just keep falling

73
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:38,895
through the cracks and you can't get
everything done that you want, if

74
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:42,405
you're new to freelancing and you're
kind of finding your stride right now,

75
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,525
or if you feel like you don't have a
reliable routine, these are things that.

76
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,380
We all struggle with no matter how
long we've been doing, whatever it is

77
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,250
that we're doing, these are things that
everyone feels and everyone encounters.

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,260
Uh, but there are ways to set yourself up
for success and to minimize the effects of

79
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,760
these feelings, uh, as a result of those,
um, feelings, you might additionally

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,330
feel overwhelmed, discouraged, lost,
depressed, or anxious, and identify these

81
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,150
things because I think it's important to.

82
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:19,305
Naming these things and acknowledge
that we are feeling them and kind of

83
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:23,655
sit with them for a moment and say,
okay, you are in the passenger seat

84
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:26,865
of my car and I'm going to be driving.

85
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:27,285
Right.

86
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,385
My depression sits right here with me.

87
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:34,275
It's with me all throughout the day,
but I'm the one driving my car on the

88
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:35,245
one, deciding where we're going to.

89
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,915
So you to be thinking to yourself,
well, what the heck is admin day?

90
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:41,695
What does that mean?

91
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,245
What does that have to do
with mental health in any way?

92
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,405
Any way, shape or form admin day is
the one month, the one day a month,

93
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:54,565
rather that you set everything else
aside and you treat yourself like your

94
00:06:54,565 --> 00:07:00,445
most important customer or client, your
most valued client, the person that you

95
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:02,905
have to focus on the most for this one.

96
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,525
It gives you a chance
to prioritize yourself.

97
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:14,955
So really admin day is a day where you
complete a series of tasks and those

98
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:19,635
tasks can include, uh, getting caught
up with your bookkeeping or your taxes,

99
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:25,965
um, reviewing your website and making
any updates, additions, maintenance, uh,

100
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,835
tasks, anything like that, to make sure
that your website is as good as it can.

101
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,560
Uh, any social media planning or
content creation that you want to do.

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,190
So scheduling out content or writing
a blog post or working on a video,

103
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,960
any number of things like that?

104
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,340
Uh, cleaning, that's actually kind
of my favorite part on admin day,

105
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,350
I will clean my whole desk area.

106
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,210
I would clean my computers.

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll clean out my inbox, my email inbox.

108
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,900
I'll get rid of old files and to my
trash and just kind of make sure that

109
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,550
I could start this month with a clean.

110
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,035
This might be a good time to sit down
and do research on something that you've

111
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:04,935
been wanting to learn or take a class,
take a workshops and things like that.

112
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:11,565
Um, accountability, we, I feel like
a lot of people like the idea of how

113
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:16,095
having accountability calls with other
people who run businesses, uh, and

114
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,355
we don't always have time for that.

115
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:21,615
So this is a good day to set an hour
aside and chat with another business.

116
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,820
Or any reporting or analytics that
you want to do looking back at the

117
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,090
previous month, seeing how things
perform, seeing how things went.

118
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,580
So these are just examples.

119
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,659
This is just a starter list, depending on
the kind of company that you've run, the

120
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,740
services you provide, the products you
create, this, this list can definitely

121
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,930
change and flex depending on you.

122
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,100
Uh, this could also just
be a day off, right?

123
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,620
This could also just be a day where
you treat yourself to a really

124
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,540
fancy, expensive cup of coffee,
where you go spend some time outside.

125
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,110
This is a picture of me on a hike.

126
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,819
I took a couple of months ago, whatever
you feel like you don't normally have

127
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,470
time for anything that you feel could
kind of give you a nice reset, uh, where

128
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,660
you can be kind of quiet and undisturbed.

129
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,340
Admin day is a really good time.

130
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:16,275
So the number one problem I hear
when I talk to people about it's

131
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:17,655
like, well, I don't have time.

132
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:18,735
I don't have time.

133
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,045
I have client work to do I have this.

134
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:21,645
I have that.

135
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,665
I have a busy schedule.

136
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,745
I have all of these things to do.

137
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:29,595
How can I take a whole day off every
month to just focus on these other things?

138
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:31,935
The solution is yes, you do.

139
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,584
Um, I promise you have time.

140
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:37,214
You can make.

141
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,584
For yourself, right?

142
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:44,834
You are the most important person you
have to put on your own mask before

143
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,805
you can put on other people's masks
that has a different connotation.

144
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:48,435
Now doesn't it.

145
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,704
But, uh, you have to help yourself
before you can help others.

146
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:57,225
Uh, we waste a lot of time throughout
the month with the negative effects

147
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,444
of not doing a lot of these things.

148
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:05,295
Uh, so if you can take a day for admin
day, you can earn back some of that

149
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,555
time that you might ordinarily do.

150
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,709
Um, and also you always have
time to seed your mental health.

151
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,329
I think that's kind of what big
orange heart, uh, is all about, right.

152
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,390
Is taking that time for yourself
and making sure that you're okay.

153
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,510
This is a really good,
structured way to do that.

154
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:27,175
So some tips to make sure that your
admin day can go smoothly and that you

155
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:31,825
can really commit to it, a block that
day off, fully on your calendar so

156
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:35,305
that if you have a Calendly or anything
like that, people can book time with

157
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:38,185
you for that day without you noticing.

158
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:41,215
I just happened to me once or twice
if I forget to block a day off.

159
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:44,605
Uh, but yeah, block that whole thing
off and make sure that nobody can book.

160
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,949
Communicate with other people in your
life, friends, family, colleagues,

161
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,630
employees, whatever that this is your day
to really focus on what you have to do.

162
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,880
Uh, and it has value beyond just
keeping up with your business.

163
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,199
It has value for your mental health.

164
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,540
Be consistent.

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,970
So for example, I really like to do admin
day, the first of every month, whatever

166
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,560
day of the week that happens to fall on.

167
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,790
If you decide I'm going to do every
day or I'm going to do the last

168
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,140
Friday of the month, um, whatever you
decide to do, just stick with that.

169
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,780
And there'll be a lot.

170
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,945
Uh, I really like to try to
get out of my normal space.

171
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,185
So maybe I just work in a
different place in my home.

172
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:32,745
Um, he used to like to go out to a
coffee shop or a library or something,

173
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,775
but see if you can get out of your
normal space just to shake things up a

174
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:39,465
little bit, um, especially, you know,
working from home these days can feel

175
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,925
very monotonous and that can really.

176
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:45,785
Also keep a handy list of
tasks throughout the month.

177
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:50,705
So maybe a sticky note on your computer
or a note on your desktop or a Google

178
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:55,055
doc, somewhere that you can throughout
the month say, oh, that's something that

179
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:56,945
I'd really like to tackle on admin day.

180
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:57,995
Let me write that down.

181
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,645
So I don't forget that way.

182
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:04,085
Admin day, you come to your computer and
you see, I have this beautiful list of

183
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:08,585
things that I've curated throughout the
previous month that I can now work on.

184
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:16,625
So I feel like there are both short and
long-term benefits to blocking out and

185
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,515
planning and completing an admin day.

186
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:25,685
Um, these are the things that I feel
the short-term benefits are that you

187
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,235
kind of regain control a little bit.

188
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:31,655
You can, like I said, have that hard
reset and feel the rest of the month.

189
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,105
Like you have a plan that
you are in control of things.

190
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:37,785
All those good feelings, right?

191
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:40,245
You have a positive start to your month.

192
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:41,564
You're in a good Headspace.

193
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,005
You're in a good place mentally.

194
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:48,735
And as you go into that next week or next
day, you feel good about yourself, right?

195
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:52,785
You accomplish something, it's
a confidence booster, right?

196
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:56,295
I feel kind of like a
boss on admin day, right?

197
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:57,795
I'm I'm getting everything done.

198
00:12:57,795 --> 00:13:00,545
I'm getting everything taken care of
and looking at how much money I made.

199
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,954
I'm looking at, you know, my
reports, my analytics, the

200
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:04,185
things that I've accomplished.

201
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,535
It makes me feel good about.

202
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,445
What it is you've accomplished
in the past month.

203
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,515
And what did you hope to
accomplish in the next month?

204
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,475
It also gives you a little
bit of perspective, right?

205
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:20,895
If you have trouble kind of seeing
the forest for the trees admin

206
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:24,315
day can give you a really good
overview of what it is you're doing.

207
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:26,895
So you're not getting lost
in the details as much, which

208
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:28,155
can cause us a lot of anxiety.

209
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,780
And like I said before, you have usually
a little bit more time in the next month.

210
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,030
You might not be scrambling
for things as much.

211
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,010
Um, you might not be stressing over,
well, I have to get a blog post out this.

212
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,750
I don't have time, but
I really want to do it.

213
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,680
It's already done.

214
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,790
You don't have to think about it.

215
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,295
The long-term benefits.

216
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:57,175
Um, and again, these are the
things that I've experienced in.

217
00:13:57,175 --> 00:14:00,115
I felt your experience
may vary, obviously.

218
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,405
Um, but it's allowed me to build a
lot of trust in myself, especially

219
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,535
if I'm able to be consistent with it.

220
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,675
I don't, I think I only missed
one admin day last year in 2021.

221
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,194
Uh, and that felt really, really good.

222
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:16,905
Um, developing those strong habits, right?

223
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:17,385
It's great.

224
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:20,115
At the end of the year, to be able
to look back and say, I did my

225
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:23,955
reporting every single month, and now
I have a whole year's worth of data.

226
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,505
I'm just getting into those habits.

227
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:31,095
Definitely pays off in the long
run again, saving time, right?

228
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:32,895
Save so much time throughout the year.

229
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:35,025
Uh, especially for
things like bookkeeping.

230
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:39,105
When you go to sit down to do your taxes
quarterly, yearly, however you do it.

231
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,444
Um, you don't have to scramble
around and collect things.

232
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,255
You have everything in one.

233
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,985
It strengthens your business, right?

234
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,415
If you're able to get that content
out, that you've been meaning to

235
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:52,755
write and get your stuff organized,
it's going to help strengthen the

236
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,465
business in little ways here and there.

237
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:59,865
The more organized you can be and
the more mentally fit you feel,

238
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,575
uh, and just logistically sets you
up for success, getting all your

239
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,225
ducks in a row is never a bad thing.

240
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:11,465
So.

241
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,630
Admin day for me was only a couple
of days ago, as I said, I usually

242
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,530
do it the first of the month.

243
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,060
So Tuesday was my admin day.

244
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,340
Uh, and just an example
of this is what I did.

245
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,500
I, uh, did a lot of bookkeeping.

246
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,845
I cleaned everything up.

247
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:26,595
Right.

248
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,694
My favorite part, I scrubbed down my desk.

249
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,105
I just conducted everything.

250
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,824
Um, I moved in, I canceled a
bunch of subscriptions because

251
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:36,885
I accidentally put a bunch of
business stuff on my PayPal account.

252
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,015
And I was like, oh no, that needs to
be in my business, blah, blah, blah.

253
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:41,865
And I didn't have time in the
month to go back and fix it.

254
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:42,525
So I was able to do that.

255
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,825
Uh, it is tax season.

256
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:48,815
So I was working on my taxes and that
was a very stressful and not fun.

257
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:53,225
Um, but what I did do that was really
fun as I sat right over there behind

258
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:58,055
the camera, where I have a nice
little, uh, seating area, and I read a

259
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:01,505
bunch of articles and blog posts that
I'd been wanting to read throughout

260
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,655
the month, that I didn't have time
to, uh, with a nice cup of tea.

261
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,335
And it was really, really relaxing.

262
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,725
So my previous admin day was actually
a little bit stressful because of the

263
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:12,125
taxes, but now I feel so much better.

264
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:14,095
It's out of the way and off my plate.

265
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:22,195
So I want to hear from you,
if you do something like admin

266
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:25,525
day, I've heard people do like
smaller admin days every week.

267
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:26,425
Like it'd be Friday.

268
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,135
Um, yes or no.

269
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:31,585
Is this something that you would be
interested in starting or is this

270
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,665
something that you've already done?

271
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,140
Not for you.

272
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Uh, you can find me on Twitter at
Ellie underscored humans, and I'd

273
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,070
really, really love to hear from you
and hear what you do on admin day.

274
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,050
That could maybe inspired me as well.

275
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,490
Um, so yeah, if we have any questions,
I'd be super happy to answer.

276
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:50,785
Cathy Tibbles: Hi.

277
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,104
Thank you so much, Allie.

278
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,145
Allie Nimmons: Hi, thank you.

279
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:54,685
Thank you.

280
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:55,375
It was a pleasure.

281
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:57,115
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah, that was live right.

282
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,104
Or was that a recorded?

283
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:00,655
Allie Nimmons: That was live.

284
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,525
Cathy Tibbles: How are you feeling?

285
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:02,814
Allie Nimmons: Good.

286
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:06,264
I feel like I talked really, really
fast, which is a bad habit of mine.

287
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:06,714
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,474
I was really excited

289
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,544
Cathy Tibbles: and it was great.

290
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:15,835
I'm curious how you came up
with the idea or did you come

291
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,145
up with the idea of Admin Day?

292
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,704
Allie Nimmons: I don't remember.

293
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,325
I honestly don't remember.

294
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:24,794
I think it might, it might've been
something that I heard somebody

295
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,494
else like write a blog post or
talk about it a long time ago, but

296
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:30,284
I've been doing it for many years.

297
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,175
And so it's now just kind of like a habit.

298
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,835
I don't really remember where
I learned, but I've evolved it.

299
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:36,165
Right.

300
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:39,165
Like figured out new things to
do over time and stuff like that.

301
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:42,165
I have a little running list, but,
um, yeah, I don't really remember

302
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,274
where I first heard about it.

303
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:44,865
Cathy Tibbles: Do you know?

304
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,149
A person would do if they
weren't a freelancer, would

305
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,949
you still think an admin day?

306
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,780
Like I'm just thinking self care day.

307
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Allie Nimmons: I mean, mental
health days and self-care

308
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,300
days are remarkably important.

309
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,139
Like whether you feel like you need it or
not, like, I feel like a lot of us will

310
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:06,260
say like, oh, I don't something happened
or maybe I don't feel great today.

311
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,719
And I'm going to, I'm going to
take a mental day for myself.

312
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,580
Um, I'd love to normalize.

313
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:14,835
Taking a day, once a month,
even when you don't need it.

314
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:15,165
Right.

315
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:17,835
Like preventative care
rather than reactive care.

316
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:22,815
Um, so yeah, like I don't see
anything wrong with that at all.

317
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:23,865
I think that would be great.

318
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:28,695
And especially if you feel like you have
tasks that you'd like to get caught up

319
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:33,254
on, um, even if it's just catching up
on a TV show or something like that,

320
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:36,165
like if you could say, all right, I'm
going to make a little to-do list for

321
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,795
myself so that I can cause one of the
things I really love about admin day is

322
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:44,025
that feeling at the end of the day, it's
like I checked everything off my list.

323
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:48,855
Um, I completed everything and that,
that always gives me a nice little kind

324
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:53,115
of confidence boost of, like I said, I
was going to do something and I did it.

325
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:53,715
And that feels real.

326
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,860
Cathy Tibbles: I could also
see that working for people.

327
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,110
Like I find to do lists
to be a lot of pressure.

328
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,690
So I kind of organize it as in like
kind of a things I want to accomplish

329
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,080
in a week, but I could still see that
working really well because there'll

330
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,240
be the day when I don't have it to do.

331
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,060
Allie Nimmons: Yeah, for sure.

332
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,630
If that's, if that's what you need,
like, I love the fact that it's,

333
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,060
it's a flexible concept, right?

334
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,010
To say, I'm going to take this day.

335
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:25,005
To-do list every other day of the year.

336
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,525
Today is the one day I'm not going
to make it to do list, right.

337
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,145
If that's what you need for yourself.

338
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:36,315
And that's, so that's very valuable and,
uh, introspective to be able to identify

339
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,745
what you need and go ahead and do that.

340
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,055
Cathy Tibbles: I just think
it's such a great idea.

341
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,065
Have you heard of time-blocking?

342
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,525
Allie Nimmons: I do time blocking.

343
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:50,085
I started doing time blocking this
year, um, more than I used to.

344
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,695
Um, and yeah, I find it very.

345
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,215
calming.

346
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
Cause I don't ever have to think
about what do I need to be doing

347
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
what I need to be working on.

348
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,810
Like I always have, I can just
look at my calendar and it tells

349
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,430
me what to do and when I go do it.

350
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,060
Cathy Tibbles: If I don't have
it time blocked, I'm just like

351
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,770
putting out fires all day.

352
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,460
It's just like, I just let the
email dictate my day instead

353
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,110
of what I should be doing.

354
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,405
And I find it, the talk
reminded me of something.

355
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:24,945
Um, like I divide my company
tasks into a bunch of stuff.

356
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:29,145
And the one that always gets ignored
for me is research and development.

357
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,215
Like with the manufacturing
has to get done.

358
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,730
In our freelance world, it's,
you know, getting the code or the

359
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,380
site done or out to the client.

360
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,780
Yeah.

361
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,870
The customer service, the marketing, it's
kind of like your content, your videos,

362
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,400
like they have to get done, but actually
the time to read those articles, like you

363
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,715
were saying, Get better at your craft.

364
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:53,085
You have to prioritize that stuff.

365
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:53,625
Allie Nimmons: Yeah.

366
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:57,105
That's, that's one of my favorite
parts of the day and that's that's,

367
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,985
I feel like the number one thing
that I tend to put off throughout the

368
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:03,045
month, um, is yeah, it's like, okay.

369
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:07,635
I, I use this one videos, like for
my next admin day, I really want to

370
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:10,875
take time to like learn a new video
editing software because I've been

371
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,955
using the same for a long time.

372
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,440
It's been getting on my nerves.

373
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,580
I don't have time usually to just say,
I'm going to completely switch to this

374
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,960
other thing and learn it on the fly.

375
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,200
Right?

376
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,700
Like that's so stressful.

377
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,920
So to say, okay, I'm going
to take it after noon.

378
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,030
I'm going to block it off.

379
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,400
If somebody asks me to do
something, I'm going to say no.

380
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,610
Um, that is very empowering.

381
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,840
Right?

382
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,190
Cause it, I think that that's
another thing too about this

383
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,330
whole thing is for that day, you,
you can say no to everything.

384
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,190
Somebody sends you a DM or an email.

385
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,780
You don't have to answer it.

386
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,330
And I think that, um, That at
least for me, gives me a lot of

387
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,960
confidence as a business owner to
say, like, I am prioritizing myself.

388
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,130
I appreciate that you need something,
but I will get to it tomorrow.

389
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,160
Um,

390
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,400
no.

391
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,290
Cathy Tibbles: No, uh, you know, Amy
Porterfield, um, years ago, I listened

392
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,120
to her all the time and she had, I think
she called it dragon hour, power hour.

393
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,399
I'm not sure, but, but she's prolific
content creator, but there's two

394
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:18,689
or three hours in the morning.

395
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:20,760
Her team didn't even contact her.

396
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,340
Like they protected her little bubble
and that was her time to work like do

397
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,960
not poke the bear between this time and
this time, it just reminds me of that.

398
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,320
Like the people who are really productive,
you have to focus on what you want.

399
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,770
To get the work for your
mental health, right?

400
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,190
Yeah.

401
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,220
Allie Nimmons: Especially if you're in a
period of, well, we should all be learning

402
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,510
all the time, but if you're in a period
of like, all right, I I'm freelancing

403
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,110
or I started this business, whatever the
case may be and now I want to scale it.

404
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,380
Right.

405
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,370
I want to grow, I want to add
a new service or I want to, you

406
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,590
know, maybe hire somebody right.

407
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,590
When, when you feel like, okay,
I need to get to that next level.

408
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,670
You have to be able to prioritize,
well, like, how am I going to do that?

409
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:02,850
I need.

410
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,795
Time away from my clients and my
deliverables and all those things,

411
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:10,785
and really get my ducks in a row and
learn what I need to learn in order

412
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:12,825
to scale to that, to that next level.

413
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,765
Cause I feel like that's, that's
such a big reason why people

414
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:19,605
struggle with scaling or don't
scale is because they don't have.

415
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:25,765
The, the, the background foundational
knowledge to, to do whatever comes

416
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,255
with that next phase of their business.

417
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:33,355
Um, and so it's, it's hard to get there
if you don't know what you have to do.

418
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:39,865
Um, and yeah, when you have to pay
bills and, uh, you know, meet whatever

419
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:46,105
monetary goals that you have, it can
feel really scary to say, like, I'm not

420
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:48,295
going to put in billable hours to do.

421
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:49,875
Right.

422
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,705
Like, that's super scary.

423
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:56,175
If you have bills to pay, they say,
I'm not going to make money today.

424
00:23:56,264 --> 00:24:01,034
I'm going to work on myself, but
in the long run, I think it does

425
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,395
enable you to grow and scale it
to make more money, you know?

426
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,980
So, yeah, it has, it has
all kinds of benefits

427
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,920
Cathy Tibbles: It does and, you
know, it's easy to say that we

428
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,240
prioritize our mental health.

429
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,580
It's harder to do when you're taking
cash off the table, but that's,

430
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,470
short-sighted like in the long-term.

431
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,020
Allie Nimmons: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

432
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,570
And so I, you know, if it's a matter
of, um, you know, I'm gonna reserve

433
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,814
an afternoon to do all to do some of
this kind of stuff, and then maybe

434
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:34,004
work your way up to a whole day, right?

435
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,975
Like, like you were saying, that
woman just had a chunk of time in

436
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,595
the morning that could work too.

437
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:38,865
Right.

438
00:24:38,865 --> 00:24:41,745
It can be whatever you can
manage to do at that time.

439
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:46,004
But I think it's always worthwhile
to say, I'm going to put aside any

440
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:49,514
amount of time for myself, and then
you can grow that as you're able to.

441
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,485
Cathy Tibbles: And you've
been doing this for years.

442
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:53,024
Yeah.

443
00:24:54,314 --> 00:24:55,004
Wow.

444
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:56,205
That's very cool.

445
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:01,875
Two minutes.

446
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:06,585
So I'm wondering if we can pick
Misty's brain and Liquid Web.

447
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:14,175
Do you have like, can people take, I
hope I'm not ousting something bad, but

448
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:17,054
can I, can people take like a morning?

449
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:25,205
Either do work-related R and D
gonna learn more about something,

450
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,185
but like not working on a project.

451
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:32,105
Misty Combs: We, we do have a lot of
flexibility, even just, if you want to

452
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:39,005
adjust your schedule to accommodate self
care mental health time, um, we have

453
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:44,765
a lot of support for that, but we also
have, um, a lot of leaders who give a

454
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:51,879
lot of flexibility and an independent
scheduling to their staff all the time.

455
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,500
So it is important that not that we
don't have that much and we don't have

456
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,340
things that need to get accomplished,
but at the end of the day, if I am

457
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,200
completely burned out and I am completely
exhausted, I'm not able to commit

458
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,750
the things that I need to do anyway.

459
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,290
So, so there's definitely an
encouragement take your PTO tip.

460
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,899
Take the time that you
need flex your schedule.

461
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:14,800
Take care of yourself.

462
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,669
Take care of your family.

463
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,129
Cathy Tibbles: PCO, did you say PCO?

464
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:18,259
Misty Combs: PTO.

465
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,750
So like your Paid Time Off.

466
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:20,534
Cathy Tibbles: Okay.

467
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:20,804
Okay.

468
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,280
That was HR speak.

469
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,150
That's good.

470
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,020
It's nice to see the bigger
companies, but we also do.

471
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,140
Misty Combs: We've also done a
lot, the things that stress people.

472
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,060
So when we, we became a more work
from home organization, we tried to do

473
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,680
things that help people be connected.

474
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,160
We also tried to do things
for all kinds of wellness.

475
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,300
Um, we have.

476
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,350
Zoom based yoga.

477
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,120
We have had series of financial education.

478
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,070
We have, uh, um, health and wellness,
diet, diet, mental health, um,

479
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,730
mindfulness, all kinds of activities
that people can participate in

480
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,480
when they're feeling stressed in
whatever way, they're feeling stress,

481
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,970
trying to give them some resources.

482
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,085
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah, that is cool.

483
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:13,205
Allie, can I switch
topics just for a second?

484
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:16,715
What is the Underrepresented
In Tech database?

485
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,635
Allie Nimmons: Oh, I was
hoping you'd ask me that.

486
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:25,235
Um, Underrepresented In Tech is a
database that, uh, myself and Michelle

487
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:27,335
Frechette, we co-founded together.

488
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,275
Um, because honestly we work at it.

489
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:37,034
Tired of people coming to us and
saying, um, you know, I'm looking to

490
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:41,774
hire someone or I'm looking to, um, get
people to apply, to speak at my event.

491
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:44,745
And I want to make sure that it's
a group, a diverse group of folks.

492
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:45,764
Do you know anybody?

493
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,995
Can you recommend anybody?

494
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:49,095
Can you ask people to
apply blah, blah, blah.

495
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:53,715
And we had a conversation about how
great it is that people want that, but

496
00:27:53,715 --> 00:28:00,104
how it sucks up a lot of our time and
our energy, um, to have to like, Yeah.

497
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:00,415
Yeah.

498
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,084
Um, and we were like, wouldn't it
be great if we had like a, like

499
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,955
a giant spreadsheet or something?

500
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:08,534
Um, and they were like,
oh, that's kind of weird.

501
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,425
Just add people to a spreadsheet
without their permission.

502
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,304
Oh, what if it was like a database
where people could add themselves?

503
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:18,135
Uh, and so we just kind of started
running with that idea and we got a lot

504
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:20,504
of support from the community around it.

505
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:27,210
Um, Gravity forms and gravity view donated
software for us to be able to build it.

506
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,010
Our hosting was donated, uh,
Yoast has donated, um, you

507
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,470
know, premium SEO tools to us.

508
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,170
Um, there's a whole list of
sponsors on our website, if

509
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:37,950
you want to check that out.

510
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,170
But yeah, it is a, it is a
database where folks who.

511
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,445
Fall into any of the underrepresented
boxes within the tech industry.

512
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,705
So people of color, people who identify
as a women, people who might be older

513
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:55,665
than the average person who works in
tech, people who have some sort of

514
00:28:55,665 --> 00:29:03,525
disability who are neurodivergent, who
are on the LGBTQIA plus spectrum, they

515
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:07,035
can add themselves to this database and
say, Hey, yeah, look, I check this box.

516
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:12,825
I am a marketer and a designer,
and this, these are the kinds of

517
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,055
opportunities I'm looking for.

518
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:17,925
I'd love to join a podcast or speak at
an event, and they add themselves to that

519
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:24,105
database and event organizers, business
owners, podcast hosts, uh, people from all

520
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:28,695
over can come to that database, plug in
what the it is that they're looking for.

521
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:32,445
So looking for a marketer to speak
on my podcast, and they're met with

522
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:38,370
a list of people, um, that they can
then contact, um, The only thing that

523
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,430
the searcher does not see is how that
person identifies as underrepresented.

524
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,420
So for example, if you're gay and you
add yourself to the database, the search

525
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,790
result is not going to say I'm gay, right.

526
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,900
That information is private and
Michelle, and I just use it as a

527
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,260
qualifier to make sure that nobody
is, is being lame and abusing it.

528
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,010
Um, but it, it has allowed us to.

529
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,710
Empower people with the ability
to prioritize diversity within our

530
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,840
community, without tokenizing people.

531
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,380
So you can go up to somebody and say,
Hey, I found you through the database

532
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,550
because I'm prioritizing diversity for
this project, but I'm approaching you.

533
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,420
And I'm asking you to apply for this
thing because of that, because you're an

534
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:27,300
expert marketer and I'm impressed with
what I saw, um, because we just, we have

535
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,300
a, we have a problem right now with.

536
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,940
People are having a hard time finding
the right ways to prioritize diversity.

537
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,860
And so they don't do it, um, and need,

538
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,230
Cathy Tibbles: It's hard for people
to ask are you special in any way?

539
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,550
Yeah, just somebody that looks different
than me, who also happens to be X word.

540
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,800
It can be an awkward conversation to
breach, especially with the person

541
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,470
that you maybe have never met before.

542
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,260
Um, and so we wanted
to make it easier for.

543
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,200
Um, and yeah, so we, we built
the database and it's been,

544
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,340
it's been really successful.

545
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,610
We have about 120 people
in the database right now.

546
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,530
Um, we don't track how it's used.

547
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,530
So, um, we don't have like data
analytics about like what companies

548
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,190
I've searched or what candidates have
gotten context or anything like that.

549
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,070
It is, as soon as you find
someone in the database, you can.

550
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:30,270
You know, send them an email or however
they have preferred to be contacted.

551
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,080
Um, and then that is a conversation for,
for those two people to have together.

552
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,080
Um, we also started a podcast.

553
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:45,180
Um, I don't really even remember why
we started the podcast, like what

554
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,250
the particular impetus was for that.

555
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,370
But Michelle and I have a lot of
conversations between the two of

556
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,440
us about things that frustrated.

557
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,730
Um, around DEI in this
community in particular.

558
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:03,840
And so on that podcast, we talk
about, um, all kinds of topics that

559
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,330
affect underrepresented people.

560
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,340
But also we try to provide information
that's useful for allies and people who

561
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,780
want to help underrepresented people
to get more opportunities and have

562
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,700
those conversations in an easier way.

563
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:24,175
Um, So, yeah, so it's a database
with the podcast that she

564
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,435
and I have started together.

565
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:28,855
Um, yeah, it's something that we're,
we're really, really proud of.

566
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:33,534
Is there anybody, are you
still open to people coming on?

567
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:37,054
Like if somebody sees this and
wants those opportunities, they can.

568
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:38,814
Allie Nimmons: Yes, absolutely.

569
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:40,794
So, absolutely.

570
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:41,125
Yes.

571
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,215
You can go to the website
https://underrepresentedintech.com.

572
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,554
Um, we have no plans of ever like.

573
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:52,605
Closing it as of right now, like it is
open for anyone, any, anybody at any time

574
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:57,525
in any place to, uh, to go to, so, oh
yeah, you have it pulled up right there.

575
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:02,745
So yeah, if you scroll up to the top of
the site there, um, there's a section

576
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:06,285
called on looking for opportunities
and somebody can click submit

577
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:10,115
profile and there's a little form.

578
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:15,420
They can add themselves to that
within 24 hours, um, Michelle, or I

579
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,020
will just let that person make sure
it's not spam or anything like that.

580
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:21,149
Um, and add them to the database.

581
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,260
And once they're added, uh, they can
come up in whatever searches applied to

582
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,780
them and they also have an individual.

583
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,600
Um, like page.

584
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,070
So if you search and find a person, you
can click on their name or their photo,

585
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,150
and they have a designated page on
the site that, you know, if they would

586
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,350
like to share and move like a resume
website or something, they have a page

587
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,930
that has all of their qualifications
and contact information on it.

588
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:51,135
Cathy Tibbles: So you'd recommend
that we, that people who are applying

589
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:54,105
to this database put something
similar to their LinkedIn or whatever

590
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:55,695
they're comfortable with the public.

591
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:57,345
Allie Nimmons: Exactly.

592
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:57,945
Exactly.

593
00:33:57,945 --> 00:34:01,754
So we ask you for a bio, we ask
you for whatever social media

594
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:02,895
you're comfortable sharing.

595
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:07,155
If you have a website, uh, to add
that, and we asked him, you know,

596
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,384
what, what do you specialize in?

597
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:09,014
What do you do?

598
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,145
Are you, are you an SEO person?

599
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:14,804
Are you a developer or do
you work with e-commerce?

600
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:18,645
We have plans in the next month
to add more of those kinds of,

601
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:22,005
um, skills to the site as well.

602
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:25,364
Um, and then you get to choose what
opportunity you're looking for.

603
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:27,884
Um, because there are lots of job
boards out there and we didn't

604
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:29,295
really want this to be a job board.

605
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:33,764
We wanted it to be a place where somebody
is like, well, I have a job, but I'd like

606
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:35,505
to expand my reach into the community.

607
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:36,525
I want to speak at events.

608
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:37,844
I want to be on podcasts.

609
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:43,065
I want to participate in other ways
so they can choose which opportunities

610
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,194
they would like to be contacted.

611
00:34:47,714 --> 00:34:48,944
Cathy Tibbles: That is really awesome.

612
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,024
Good for you guys.

613
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:56,294
Thank you for coming on and the talk, did
you have any other last minute thoughts?

614
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:58,995
Allie Nimmons: Um, no.

615
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,515
I just hope that everyone
enjoys the rest of the event.

616
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:05,714
And, uh, please thank an emcee
or an organizer or a volunteer

617
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:08,865
because they work amazingly hard.

618
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,850
Um, for no money, a lot of volunteers
they're doing it out of the goodness of

619
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,710
their hearts and it's extremely admirable.

620
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,240
Uh, so yeah.

621
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:18,690
Thanks.

622
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,400
If you're watching, please take a
moment to thank somebody, um, because

623
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,700
yeah, it's, this is a beautiful
event and a beautiful thing, and I'm,

624
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,069
I'm just overwhelmed with emotion.

625
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,140
