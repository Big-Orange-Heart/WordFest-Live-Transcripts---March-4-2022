00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,435

72
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:54,375
Um, okay.

73
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:59,355
Let's talk about hacking, security and
so on and how to recover after a hack.

74
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:00,525
Um,

75
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,140
I hope that you guys were up up already.

76
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,190
Um, but, uh, one of the
questions, uh, important here

77
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,230
is have you been hacked already?

78
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,500
Uh, just please raise your hand.

79
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,799
Oh, yeah, I see a lot of hands there.

80
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:20,760
No, I was kidding.

81
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:21,840
We are digital.

82
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,229
This isn't possible, but probably, a lot
of you guys has, uh, suffer a hack, uh,

83
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,590
in one moment or another, uh, in your
digital world and your digital life.

84
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,969
And if not, you will.

85
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:38,280
So this guy is important.

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,750
Let me share with you so on my
impression, because I suffered in that.

87
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:50,085
And um, uh, in first person,
uh, this kind of hack, uh, and I

88
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:55,065
feel, I felt all the answer to the
older, all the, what I have to do.

89
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:59,595
And so on just before, before I
came, I joined, uh, security and

90
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:02,985
GoDaddy, eh, and it was just a.

91
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:07,845
It was an er it was a nightmare
because, uh, you know, uh,

92
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,135
you don't know what to do.

93
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,485
You don't know where to go.

94
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:11,745
You don't  know what to find.

95
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,575
And the customers are yes.

96
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:15,405
Uh, ringing you and so on.

97
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:18,225
So then let me share with you some tricks.

98
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:22,235
You can do some, uh, uh,
again, a little guide.

99
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,900
To help you with, uh, you know,
to help you with your anxiety and

100
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,710
your, or your feelings, uh, with
the power of action right now.

101
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,570
So let's just, uh, let's just put in the
situation that you have being hacked.

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,000
For example, you have been defaced
with a skin like this one, uh, yeah.

103
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,170
Or, or you get all your
files encrypted and so-on.

104
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:48,930
Yeah.

105
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,290
I know.

106
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,195
It's pretty tough.

107
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:51,555
Okay.

108
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:52,695
So let's scream.

109
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:53,355
You can, yes.

110
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,905
Let's your feel out?

111
00:06:56,085 --> 00:07:00,974
Um, um, this, and is accepted also
to be down a little bit, uh, but the

112
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:07,995
important part is after that, when you
get all your feelings out, let's act.

113
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:08,565
Okay.

114
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:13,664
So this is the guide of the things
that should you should do before that.

115
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:19,815
Uh, normally I am, uh, share some kind of
concepts because we should put some care.

116
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:25,065
Uh, things clear before, um,
uh, troubleshooting these

117
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,385
kind of scenarios, right?

118
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:33,285
So those of you that, uh, has, uh, seen
any of my presentation, you will see

119
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:40,245
that this slide is appearing in all
of them, this guy is a CIA, a C E O of

120
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:44,505
Cisco, which is a very big company of
global communications around the world.

121
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,405
And he says that there are two
types of companies, those who has

122
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:52,195
been hacked and those who don't
yet know they have been hacked.

123
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:58,375
So, you know, dealing with, uh, cyber
security or with the internet could

124
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,025
be a little bit of stress, right.

125
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:04,565
They used to have a lot of,
um, uh, threats are out there.

126
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:09,325
There is a lot of terms and
there is a lot of things to know.

127
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:12,015
Um, yeah, it could be a
little bit of a warning.

128
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,585
So, let me put some things clear.

129
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,335
For example, I normally talk about
hackers, the difference between

130
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:23,205
hackers and cyber terrorists
hackers, a curious person who will

131
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,585
be your limits and convention.

132
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:28,515
I always say that, um, if you
are a little bit sleepy and you

133
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,455
just, take a coffee, you are just

134
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:31,625
hacking yourself.

135
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,600
You are, uh, what we call bio-hacking.

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:35,840
Right.

137
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,230
Um, even if you use a part of a
bottle for all the thing or something

138
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,340
like that, you are hacking as well.

139
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,930
So it's important to not.

140
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,110
Uh, take wrong this, this term, right?

141
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,870
So as cyber terrorist is a one kind of
hackers, a computer hacker, which is, um,

142
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,560
whose mission is to enrich himself, right?

143
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,069
Yes.

144
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,490
Uh, we always say that the bad
guy, right or the bad hacker.

145
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:07,675
Also it's important to understand
that security is not a whole list

146
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:10,734
is component of the layers, right?

147
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:16,314
Is, um, uh, this is a simplified
model in, in the web security part,

148
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:19,420
but the, you know, Cyber security.

149
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,540
There has a lot of fields and we
are talking right now about, uh,

150
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,990
WordPress sites or web security.

151
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,290
So let me just pull it up in the
screen, the layers more or less.

152
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,290
I mean, it's, I mean, this is a
simplified model, uh, the layers we

153
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,330
have to take care on just to, uh,
decrease the risk of being hacked.

154
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,600
Right?

155
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,510
So at the end, we are users.

156
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,690
It doesn't matter if you are
the admin, you are the customer

157
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,730
or you are a hosting provider.

158
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:01,635
Uh, uh, Operator or whatever,
there's a person, you know, we

159
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:05,925
can be, eh, eh, can be cheated.

160
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:06,225
Right?

161
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:09,255
So we are, we always say that
the, that the persons, the

162
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,995
human being is weakest today.

163
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:11,265
Right?

164
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:13,995
So there is a device we use to connect.

165
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:20,520
We use the connection, things just goes
through, uh, We have, you know, the

166
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,890
traffic that hits your website, there
is the use of credentials, password

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,989
for authorization, for the different
tasks you will like to do in a website.

168
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,329
There's a, some kind of layer of
where security website security.

169
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,410
There is some kind of layer in the
server security and also the database.

170
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,739
Keep in mind that the web model has also.

171
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:52,324
separated, the presentation part and
the information part information in

172
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:56,255
the database and the presentation
is all the files, design and so on.

173
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:05,525
So the counter measures or, um, the,
the things we have to, uh, work in for

174
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:11,344
protecting these layers of course in
the, in the part of persons of, of human

175
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,724
beings, uh, isn't knowledge, we should.

176
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:16,875
Learn things.

177
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,845
So we should just attend to
this kind of lectures and so

178
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,125
on to know what is going on.

179
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,465
I where to, uh, where to look, right.

180
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:29,065
And again, if you are using a
device, you can start antivirus

181
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,465
or you're using a connection.

182
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,965
Keep also keep in mind to use a
SSL certificate so you can use.

183
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:42,795
Eh, S no, it's the HTTP protocol
is the HTTPS, the secure one.

184
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:47,125
So if you're talking about
traffic, you can install a WAF,

185
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,685
for me is the best protection.

186
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,245
So it's a web application firewall.

187
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:52,365
Yeah.

188
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:58,445
So then outside of there, um, in
the kind of  authorisation and so

189
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:03,055
on, you got to use strong passwords,
second factor authentication on in

190
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:07,145
the part of the website, both side
on the server and the database.

191
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,815
The important is just
to monitor it closely.

192
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:12,980
And install the updates,
but there's another layer.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,680
This is important.

194
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,210
This is not a once in lifetime checklist.

195
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,540
This is something we have to
check continuously, continuously.

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,660
That's why I put another layer,
which is the maintenance.

197
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,920
So we have to do this.

198
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,900
and check this every time.

199
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,570
So this is important.

200
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,760
Other part importantly,
how WordPress is infected.

201
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,010
So we have.

202
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:35,505
Yeah.

203
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,584
If we get infected, these are the
parts of the infection, right?

204
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:44,834
So to get a WordPress infected, there
should be a vulnerability somewhere

205
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:51,975
when there is a piece of software
that, uh, exploits that vulnerability

206
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,255
and then happens to the injection.

207
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,564
The injection could be just final code.

208
00:12:56,594 --> 00:13:00,105
They just put the spam, I guess, the
deface, your website, I just, put it

209
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:01,814
down and remove the fires or whatever.

210
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:08,535
Or the worst scenario if we brought the
up backdoor, which is a piece of software

211
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,825
that allows me to access to the website,
even if the vulnerability is  black.

212
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:13,215
Right?

213
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:17,985
So when you have a backdoor inside, you
can do all the final code things also.

214
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:22,035
Uh, but whenever you want, not
only when they went brevity, sorry.

215
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:27,955
So facts, I would love also to share
with you guys, normally, uh, hacking

216
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,125
is not easily is not client oriented.

217
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:35,145
So if you, when you get hack,
normally the first question is why me?

218
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:35,925
Why me?

219
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:42,585
I half a kitty, uh, feed the shop online.

220
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:45,045
So why they attack me normally they are.

221
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:51,314
don't care, what you are, what
you are a using you WordPress, how

222
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,605
you are using the word purpose.

223
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,995
If you are using this state, just enroll.

224
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,625
There were the website using the
vulnerabilities in their, uh,

225
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,925
vulnerable sites so they can hack
whatever they need something.

226
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:09,120
It always, almost always happens
because of that lack of maintenance.

227
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,450
Right.

228
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,890
So that's why it's important.

229
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,670
Uh, keeping also keep in mind
also that SSL certificate is

230
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,900
not an anti-hacking shield.

231
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,520
So you should, uh, understand that
having SSL certificate is not going

232
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,540
to protect you from getting hack.

233
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,680
It's going to protect the
communications between that entity

234
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,190
or user your wherever and the server.

235
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,010
So the communications
here is a secure channel.

236
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,845
If you hope put here as an
entity, . an, er, bad hacker, which

237
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,495
is trying to hack your website.

238
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:43,335
So there's a certificate when I made
this hacking attempts secure, right?

239
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:47,595
So it's, it's a  important part,
but it's not an anti-hacking shield.

240
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,425
Also keep in mind, this is very important
that patches and security updates

241
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:57,015
appear, uh, after an exploit discover.

242
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:01,835
So if you find that you see there is
an update, like with a security patch.

243
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:07,969
Be sure or almost sure that there is
an exploited, uh, being used on the

244
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:14,930
wild out there also, but hackers or
bad guys, uh, are always checking them

245
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:19,819
their patches because when they say
that there is a patch of the security,

246
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,250
uh, That's a good patch inside.

247
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,500
Uh, they try to figure it out.

248
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:30,170
The why has been, uh, uh, deployed
so they can leverage all of the older

249
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,120
sites that haven't been updated.

250
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,380
So that's why it's important to
update, uh, Very quickly, right.

251
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,200
And the other part is er, assuming
that we are human we've failed.

252
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,400
So that's why it's a security
is never, nor will never is.

253
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,460
And nor will be in the
future 100% effective.

254
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,160
We have to reduce the
risk of being hacked.

255
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,680
So going into, into the, into
the mother, if you get hacked.

256
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,615
Well, uh, what's um, what are the steps?

257
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:03,915
Right.

258
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:10,814
So let me put here the agents in
bold, if that happens, it's you at

259
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:13,795
your site, but also your customers.

260
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:16,064
So if you are, uh, under.

261
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:22,265
Uh, country, which has data, privacy,
law, uh, law, or something like that.

262
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:23,795
You have to be aware of that.

263
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:27,785
So if there is a leak of information
of sensitive information from your

264
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:31,895
website, you have to know the law that
is applied to you and to your customer,

265
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:37,775
because maybe you have to, uh, mega
worry that the authorities about that.

266
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,285
And we were going to
talk about this later.

267
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,665
There's another layer, which
is the hosting providers.

268
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:48,255
After these parts of this taking
care of this part, we can't

269
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,055
just contact hosting providers.

270
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:56,025
Majority of securities can be, uh, can
be solved digitally with the by, the

271
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,665
hosting providers support department.

272
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,475
And also you can apply as a backup or
something like that with their help.

273
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:09,800
And if those agents are not able and not
able to solve the security issue, This

274
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,790
is the moment when you have to hire, or
you have to get in touch with security

275
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,250
expert, that can be internal, your hosting
provider or external services, but this

276
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,590
talk, going to be in this part, right?

277
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,850
So what can you do if you get
a hack on what are the first

278
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,730
aids you will, er should do.

279
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,985
So it's important that mission,
we can take our two kind

280
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,845
of measures fire up fair.

281
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:36,795
The first of one is the reactive one.

282
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:40,665
Whereas this is when
something already happened.

283
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,175
Something bad already happened.

284
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,525
It's a pain, mitigation
or damage mitigation.

285
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,745
And this is what we
call incident response.

286
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:53,865
And there is a proactive, uh, set
of, uh, actions we can take before.

287
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:58,515
Anything bad happens, but this still
going up, but going to center, we're

288
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:02,115
going to focus in the react part
because we put in this scenario

289
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,765
that you have been hacked already.

290
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:05,865
So The response.

291
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,310
Here's the response is the effort
to quickly identify, minimize the

292
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:17,040
effects and contain the damage,
uh, or the, these adverse events.

293
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,340
Right?

294
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:24,830
So reactive measure, as we
normally  as interim response, it

295
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,149
starts with it's scan of your site.

296
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,189
So the first of the fault is.

297
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,275
Don't do a blind hits.

298
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:35,004
Just let's try to figure
out what happened.

299
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:35,245
Right?

300
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:36,745
So scan your site.

301
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:41,125
We'll be keeping in mind that
normally with separate sites in

302
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,315
two, in two ways, in three ways.

303
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,955
Really the first one is the
front end is what they use

304
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,054
or receive in their browsers.

305
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:53,115
The second one is the backend
is what happened in the server.

306
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,645
You are, you have higher.

307
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,995
And the third one is we're
happening the database, right?

308
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:05,745
The last two is difficult to
scan if you are not skilled,

309
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:07,194
but the front end is easy.

310
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:12,675
You can use, for example, site check,
uh,  from Securi, free a scanner that

311
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,534
you're going to take a snapshot of.

312
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:20,895
What is the scene in your website and
analyze it, the checking for patterns.

313
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:21,405
And so on.

314
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:25,125
Also you have, uh, uh,
plugins in your website.

315
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,125
Some of them yesterday
includes some scanners.

316
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:35,565
Uh, I normally, I normally, I
assume that we are talking the, we

317
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:39,705
are, we are assuming he has will
have a big budget of security.

318
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,945
So that's why I recommend the
free tail free trial plugins

319
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,205
scanners, like the Wordfence one.

320
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:44,775
Okay.

321
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,595
So update everything, including service.

322
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:51,015
Are we going to get to this
point later is this is just a.

323
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,720
Yes, uh, uh, quickly checklist
and then the CRC check remove or

324
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,710
change, which is the most boring
part, but this is important as well.

325
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,930
And if any of these is not working,
or, you need to restore a backup.

326
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,300
Keep in mind that after
restoring a backup, we'll have

327
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,710
to back to the first part.

328
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,370
Okay.

329
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,960
So scanning as a, as a.

330
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:16,125
Uh, told before is yes.

331
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,555
Let's, uh, figure it out  what happened?

332
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,315
Uh, the site check, we don't
have talking about that.

333
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:26,115
And eh, the use of any
file plugins can answer.

334
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:29,565
And if you have, uh, access to the
server and you have skill enough, you

335
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,515
can use  ClamAV or something like that.

336
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:35,535
So these kinds of things going to give
some information, for example, this is

337
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:39,425
a screenshot for, from a site check.

338
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:42,135
And in this case, are
you going to see here?

339
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,300
There's a jQuery.js uh, infected, right?

340
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,410
So yeah, we can, in this way,
we can know that there is

341
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,740
something in the BP includes,
which is a core file or a folder.

342
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,160
Sorry.

343
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,380
So this is a file infected is infected
inside of the core files of WordPress.

344
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,445
And this is invaluable information.

345
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:08,295
So the update, why I say that to update
we should today, everything right.

346
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:13,875
And keep in mind that this patches a
security world is, but the most important

347
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,455
part for me in this talk is study.

348
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:21,355
When you update, you will override
compromised and corrupt code with a

349
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:25,425
trustworthy code from official repository,
which means that if you are, they were,

350
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,235
for example, they be being closed on.

351
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:34,530
VPN in, all the files that are needed is
get over-written with the, uh, good ones.

352
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:34,980
Right?

353
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,190
So if there is malware, as we saw,
so in the previous example, inside of

354
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:47,190
the core file of  of folders, uh, in
this way, you just get rid of them.

355
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:52,905
It is a very easy way, eh, to
troubleshoot this kind of thing.

356
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:57,135
So as I mentioned, just go to
wordpress.org  download the

357
00:21:57,135 --> 00:22:02,264
WordPress, eh, uh, separate
file the exact version you have.

358
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:06,524
And then just remove, uh, when,
when you extract, uh, what is

359
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:10,764
inside of this secret file, remove
the  wp-content, wp-config.PHP

360
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:14,835
file because those are important
for our website and we don't want.

361
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,230
Uh, you know, uh,
accidentally overwrite them.

362
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,159
So removing those are highlighted, the
wp-content folder and wp-config.php.

363
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,360
We can just go and.

364
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:33,885
Uh, take all these files and folder
and just over-writ, override what

365
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,835
we have in our website, doing this.

366
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:42,045
We just get a fresh and updated  WordPress
version that we know that the all, all

367
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:43,935
the core files and folders are clean.

368
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:49,190
The most more important, which is check,
remove, and change, which is yeah.

369
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,870
Check for undeeded  admin users,
plugins that we don't need themes

370
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,149
that are themes that we don't need.

371
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,139
Keep in mind that themes should
be only two always in your list.

372
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,910
There should be only two themes.

373
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,719
The theme that you are actually using
and at the default one only one default

374
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,540
one, because it's going to, uh, you
got to work as a fail over themes.

375
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,310
If something bad happened
with the other theme.

376
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,320
You're going to start with a default
one, remove  with any updated backups,

377
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,090
uh, any defin, uh, under development or
test sites in your brochure and started.

378
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,450
But you should understand that, um,
a website secure, uh, mostly secured

379
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,490
website in internet should have.

380
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:40,320
The finest WordPress final version in our
production server are all the experiments,

381
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:44,970
all the tests, all under-development
themes  in a separate server.

382
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,360
Okay.

383
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,870
This is boredom.

384
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,610
Change all the password of the admin
users, all the password, including the

385
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,500
database, including the cPanel FTP, SSH

386
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,550
because if a hacker a bad
hacker gets into your website.

387
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,760
Reading the BB config PHP you
have, for example, the password

388
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,900
to expose your database.

389
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,320
So it's important to review all
of the, and also it's a good

390
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,270
habit to periodically change.

391
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:12,620
them.

392
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:14,864
So this is an example that
you can see in the left.

393
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:19,274
Do we have a lot of
default themes in style?

394
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,925
They shouldn't be like this.

395
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,324
Just keep one and update it.

396
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:28,334
And in the right, you can see
a lot of means, which maybe

397
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,495
they add mean for a user.

398
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:34,245
And the janitor on the levy, the docent
in the red tapes, uh, are probably

399
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,405
legit, but the admin is not one.

400
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,220
Let's see the email and the
other ones could be just, you

401
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,580
know, leftovers or, uh, outdated.

402
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,070
So check this from time to time.

403
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,570
And that's the last
option restore a backup.

404
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,510
Keep in mind, as you restore a backup,
it shouldn't be the first option

405
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,250
because you can lose information.

406
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,330
And with us always, we don't
always know what, sorry.

407
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,920
When will the infection began?

408
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,335
We can restart then the malware.

409
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:09,975
About backups is important to check
that we have a good backup strategy.

410
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:13,889
Uh, if you you don't know how to
do this, It's better if you just

411
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,210
rely in the hosting provider ones.

412
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:21,570
So invest in a good hosting,
which has, uh, backups, a good

413
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,600
backup strategy, never restore the
backups in the production server.

414
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,770
As I mentioned before, we
can, we can infect the backup.

415
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:33,450
And then from there we can infect
from inside the real sites.

416
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:40,110
So, eh, any, any security rule
you may have going to be useless

417
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,399
if the infection comes from.

418
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:42,915
That's it.

419
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:47,325
That's why also way we recommend all
to have the approach and server to

420
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:52,035
have there only there the production,
the final WordPress in that server

421
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,485
check that their backup is functional.

422
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:54,795
Okay.

423
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:57,285
So let me remain functional.

424
00:25:57,675 --> 00:26:01,935
So sometimes we just do backups, but
the, they don't work or they are not

425
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,955
completed or something like that.

426
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:06,855
So check their backups are
complete in a separate environment.

427
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:08,525
So something like that is a good habit.

428
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,425
So remember  scan, there was updates CRC.

429
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:16,575
And if you had to restore a
backup, just go back to one.

430
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:19,335
I understand again.

431
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:22,305
So this is the checklist.

432
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:28,995
So what happens with reputation, uh, is
important that, uh, we should understand

433
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:33,525
that internet is constantly being crawled
by boats, not only searching giants

434
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:38,445
bots, we know, you know, for example,
Google ones and so on, but also bots for.

435
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,510
Uh, other entities are
just crawling internet.

436
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,070
So certain, certain Jina
and security vendors have

437
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,110
normally have their block list.

438
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,590
Right?

439
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,950
So those are minds that they
don't re they don't trust on them.

440
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,990
So the blocks is hard, hard linkage
with the reputation because eh, the

441
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,210
most, the far most block list, the more
widely accepted and the more actions

442
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,565
take  uh, So where's your post or your
domain, or is your customer so on if

443
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:12,284
you are, uh, under their, their network?

444
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:12,524
Right?

445
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:17,925
So as what they mean is if you are, for
example, posting something in Facebook

446
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:23,295
and Google or Facebook, Facebook, I don't
think if they will have a block-list,

447
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:27,135
but the, for example, Google has a
block list, block list at your domain.

448
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:34,320
Uh, Uh, Facebook is just going to put that
your domain,  has been blacklisted, so

449
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,730
they don't allow you to post or they going
to add something like, okay, decide maybe,

450
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,830
uh, having hack or something like that.

451
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,830
So you're going to affect your
reputation, but keep in mind that the

452
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:52,105
reputation link to the, uh, To their
black list is not an immediate process.

453
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:52,525
Okay.

454
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:55,105
So the inclusions in the
black list takes time.

455
00:27:55,135 --> 00:28:01,585
So if you are in a black list is because
your infection hasn't been a detected.

456
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,865
And there's time that it
has been in your  website.

457
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:11,265
So that's why it's important to
detect faster, uh, any intrusion and

458
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:13,275
the de-listing also, it takes time.

459
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:17,895
So normally there are reconsiderations
is a manual process normally, so it

460
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,685
could take three to five business days.

461
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:21,945
So it's important.

462
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,500
Even more, if you are talking
about ads companies, um, some

463
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,260
normally they don't give you
information why they had your site.

464
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,010
well have been is included
in our block list.

465
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,390
Well, sometimes not always, but
sometimes just for giving you an

466
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,780
example, I remember social networks
block or worry about your post.

467
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,400
If you are in a.

468
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:49,875
In a blocked company, but ads
company can block a whole campaigns.

469
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:54,795
And this is very interesting because for
example, I know the example of Google

470
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:57,705
ads, because it's pretty, pretty funny.

471
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:02,685
Even if Google says it clear every
blacklist vendor out there says

472
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:08,085
it's clear, eh, they normally
take a lot of time to, to.

473
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:13,885
To allow your campaigns
going and going live again.

474
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:19,105
So they talk normally around two
weeks or sometimes even a month.

475
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,465
So don't delay.

476
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:24,175
That's why it's important to
not get into any block lists.

477
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:29,835
And that's why it's important
to get, uh, uh, to get to detect

478
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:35,755
faster, your intrusion and your
site before this hits this step.

479
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:43,115
Oh, so if someone's search
giants remove some of you results

480
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,675
and some of them also just to
remove or resets your ranking,

481
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:48,284
so it could be very damage.

482
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:52,605
There's another important thing
to mention, I mentioned it before.

483
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:56,739
It's, according to data protection it
might be mandatory to report the personnel

484
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:58,750
data breached to supervisory authorities.

485
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,330
For example, in Europe, GDPR, give 70
72 hours after a breach is detected.

486
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,230
So check the law.

487
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,460
Uh, which can be applied to the
person who is affected for a breach.

488
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,870
I say, know, there are some
laws and not from ASIA.

489
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,170
Uh, I'm not sure about that, but there
is some examples I collected for you.

490
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,960
There's a, you know, the New Zealand
privacy act 2020, the APPI for in Japan.

491
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,540
So it's called a P IPA, eh, PA
uh, Thailand PDPA, and so on.

492
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:31,790
So.

493
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:35,465
Just be aware of this
is not only your site.

494
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:39,875
It's also, uh, the applicable
law in the country.

495
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:44,625
You are operating on the country of
your customers who suffer a leak.

496
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:50,375
So the troubleshooting you know, now
what happened with the reputation

497
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:52,445
and the, these kind of things.

498
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:56,715
Uh, so once the site is
cleared, Go to VirusTotal.

499
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:00,855
total.com puts your URL of your
domain there, and you can get

500
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:04,455
a huge list,, a huge list of
black list of vendors out there.

501
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:09,285
So every one of these points
that says anything else done

502
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,175
clear that clean, sorry.

503
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:15,435
You have to submit individually
to them for a reconsideration,

504
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,535
but only once the site is clean.

505
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:20,355
Because if not, they're
going to just say something.

506
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:23,385
I don't get your, your
domain from the black list.

507
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:30,660
And maybe you can put yourself
in a . Uh, More, uh, time

508
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,690
list, right on the last part.

509
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,750
Then the reputation part is just to give
a post-mortem report is hard because

510
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,270
sometime exposes your management, but.

511
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,920
It should be something like, okay guys, I
have, uh, I have, um, suffer a hack attack

512
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,810
and this is more or less what's happening.

513
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,010
How I did discover when I covered
this is the lessons learned one

514
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,780
where you have what I going to
apply to not letting this happen.

515
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,910
Again, this is important because
you can learn from these situations.

516
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,180
You can recover users
trust because at the end.

517
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:16,110
You going to take all of us,
uh, in one moment and also shows

518
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,430
your company has a transparency.

519
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,940
Advocated.

520
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,570
This is something I recommend is not
mandatory, but I recommend that is

521
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,120
you suffer a major leak or a hack.

522
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:29,274
Especially, if you have density formation,
do a post mortem sensitive public.

523
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:29,865
Okay.

524
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:35,205
So not that it's not important
to, to give, uh, you know, secrets

525
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:39,825
in this post-mortem, but just to
transmit to people that, Hey, okay,

526
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:46,155
we have this, we have suffered these
transparency abrogated, so, okay.

527
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:47,475
So at this moment we have.

528
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:53,335
Covered the checklist cover the reputation
point and you know, I always talk

529
00:32:53,335 --> 00:32:56,845
house out loud practice measure what
we can do to avoid that this happens.

530
00:32:57,785 --> 00:33:03,325
And anytime again, so just the
CRC applied the same yesterday.

531
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:06,274
This admins, plugins and themes
apply the least privileged.

532
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:11,574
Use password manager check
periodically strong ones back ups.

533
00:33:11,595 --> 00:33:12,345
Validate them.

534
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:14,264
Please updates apply.

535
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:20,175
Always, as I said is important because
it overrides any, eh, malware in the

536
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:23,895
core files,  folders, monitor your site.

537
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:25,695
You can use WPSane.com for example.

538
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,150
your site or use a file integrity scanner.

539
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,840
Normally the final stage, the scanner
is included in any security plugin, like

540
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,340
Wordfence or Securi  or all in one themes.

541
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,240
Themes.

542
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:44,205
. But install a WAF, this
is important as well.

543
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:47,195
WAF is probably the
best proactive measures.

544
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,375
You can start in your website.

545
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:52,155
It's something like if you go out and it's
raining, you're going to take a umbrella.

546
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,955
That's why I put the red icon there.

547
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:59,115
So the WAF is the same as you go online,
put that in front of your website.

548
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:03,705
So you can , it's going
to act as an umbrella.

549
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,540
And remember to invest
in hosting as security.

550
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,260
So, uh, we should have this in our mind
when we design a site that we have to

551
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,429
invest some money in hosting of security,
always by default in the beginning, so

552
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,449
I was saying, see everybody in a hacker.

553
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:27,490
I think hackers just improve
the curiosity of the human

554
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,090
being and they are obligated to.

555
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,165
make things always better in the, in the
world is not a lift the same as a bad

556
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:45,045
hacker  person, curious, which will help
a lot in the progress of the human being.

557
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:46,725
That's all guys.

558
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:48,045
Thanks a lot.

559
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:53,165
Hope, uh, this, uh, has of, up to
you guys and I open to questions.

560
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:09,715
Michelle: Yeah.

561
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:12,085
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Okay.

562
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:14,425
Well, thank you very much.

563
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:16,435
Michelle: It's a good to have you.

564
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,050
Yeah, your presentation was wonderful.

565
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,150
Uh, I'm not seeing a ton of questions.

566
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm seeing everybody agreeing
with you, which was wonderful.

567
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,080
I think lots of people are saying yes,
functional backups, functional backups.

568
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,840
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte:
I have faced this.

569
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:40,025
I have faced this that lots of times
the customers say no, I have a backup.

570
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:40,335
Okay.

571
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:45,285
Share with me when I check it is
corrupt that, oh, it's only one half.

572
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,165
This is a pain, is a pain.

573
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,755
Michelle: I have it on
a thumb drive somewhere.

574
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:54,365
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Yeah.

575
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:54,995
That happened.

576
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:58,655
That happened to me as well, a customer
I would say something like, Hey, I have

577
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,425
a memory flash with a backup somewhere.

578
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:00,725
Yes.

579
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:03,305
Give me some days to
look at it and say, okay,

580
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:11,705
Michelle: I was speaking at WordCamp
Montreal one year, maybe five years ago.

581
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:12,635
And I was free.

582
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,075
This was back in my freelance days.

583
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:17,275
When I didn't know better
and made so many mistakes.

584
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:22,065
And as I'm driving to Montreal, I'm
getting all of these phone calls from

585
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:27,045
customers because I was using the
same hosting space for everybody.

586
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:33,855
So one customer got hacked and
it bled into 23 other websites.

587
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,660
And I'm in the middle of a six hour
drive and can do nothing, nothing to

588
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,959
like, and I didn't know what to do.

589
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:47,399
And so I, I went through and cleaned
up like 1300 files overnight.

590
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:51,720
And by the next day it was hacked
again, because I had no idea that

591
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,520
they just created their own users.

592
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,569
And I had to go in and delete the, oh
my gosh, it was the worst experience.

593
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,120
And I wish that on nobody.

594
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,814
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: I
will there that will bear this.

595
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:05,265
Uh, that's what we call
cross site contamination.

596
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:08,415
That's why I mentioned the
two to remove all the backups.

597
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:12,854
And if you can also get all the
websites, separating insulate in your,

598
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:17,595
in your own server is the best way to
avoid this cross' site contamination.

599
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:22,185
Because even as you have a WAF, you
have, uh, any security thing or whatever.

600
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:26,380
It er it into her in a cross
site contamination situation.

601
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,890
They, they are useless because
they contamination goes from in.

602
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:34,060
So it's, it's impossible to stop
that, that you can guess monitor.

603
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,780
And you can just see the, the, you
know, the reports, if you have a file

604
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,110
triggered the scanner or something like
that saying, oh, there's a lot of files

605
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,170
that has been changed in the last hour.

606
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,960
Why then that's the only part that you
can just only expect that be a spectator.

607
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:54,615
Michelle: And they usually wait until
after 30 days until it fires so that

608
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:56,955
you don't have the backups on the host.

609
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,884
So you have to look for backups someplace
else, which is never, never fun.

610
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,975
And for this case, it was the CGI bin.

611
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,115
Like nobody looks in their CGI bin.

612
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:06,465
Right?

613
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:09,555
So like, it was, that's where
the, the original file was.

614
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,475
It's like I went through
and deleted all of that.

615
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:12,705
It was terrible.

616
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:15,945
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: So
I was saying, damn not.world.

617
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:22,240
When the SSL certificates gets in, but
inside of that folder, there is a lot

618
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,810
of malware sometimes as well, because
it's a typical one that you don't know,

619
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,589
you don't check, but also because in
their file managers, you don't have

620
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,950
activated the dot visability files.

621
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,870
So the dot well known folder
is not visible, visible, so you

622
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,690
don't check it and get infected.

623
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:45,225
Michelle: It's not fun when that happens
and your customers do not like it.

624
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:51,195
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: And especially
if you are in the middle, right.

625
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:55,365
and so on something like, oh, come
on, I have to deal with my anxiety

626
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:59,505
with the customer anxiety, and
then you have to deal with any,

627
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,835
any security team or something like
that to recover your, your status.

628
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,470
Michelle: But, but only a
person who works at a place like

629
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,580
Securi ends their presentation
with everybody needs a hacker.

630
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,370
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Yeah.

631
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:18,360
It's, it's something like, uh, you
know, personal campaign I would

632
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,610
like to, to doing, to encourage
people to these  curious right.

633
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,980
To, to go beyond, but the problem is, are
they going to beyond the laws is not the,

634
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,790
is not the point I'm trying to force.

635
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,180
Right.

636
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,790
That's why I made a distinction,
but the yes, I don't know.

637
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,660
I don't know.

638
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,790
I super fan of this kind of video of
five minutes of hackings something

639
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:49,560
and you know, they, they, they take
the cap of the bottles to do some

640
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,780
funny stuffs or they're using another.

641
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,174
totally blow your mind, uh,
situations, uh, something like that.

642
00:39:56,174 --> 00:40:00,835
That for me, that's hacking as well and,
and I don't know, it's something personal

643
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:05,105
Michelle: having a good, um, a
good security plugin is good, but

644
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,595
you also have to make sure the
security plugin stays up to date.

645
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:09,694
So if you're not updating your
plugins and things like that,

646
00:40:09,694 --> 00:40:11,225
you're running those risks as well.

647
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:11,825
Yeah.

648
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,270
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: And the
people listen, understand why?

649
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,400
Because the, you know, Brian's updates
because they, they get new signature

650
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,380
Neo techniques discovered just
recently discovered to hack websites

651
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:31,340
or the most updated, the plugin you
have, uh, more able to get there.

652
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:36,230
The, you know, the, the intrusion
and faster to avoid that.

653
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,610
For example, the reputational harm.

654
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:38,880
Michelle: Yeah.

655
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,730
It's like shutting all the windows,
but leaving the front door open.

656
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,650
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: I always
say that you can close everything in

657
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,050
your and yours and your house, but if
you leave her one, one window open?

658
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,220
It's useless.

659
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,360
Michelle: It doesn't matter.

660
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:54,930
That's right.

661
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,440
Ola, do you have any questions for
Néstor before I let let him go.

662
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,250
Olamideyelo: All right.

663
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,900
Just the mean, I think my favorite
part of the favorite part of the

664
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,630
session was, um, what you said about.

665
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,820
You know, there are two types
of companies, those who have

666
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,380
been hacked, and those who don't
know they have been hacked.

667
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,180
I mean, how will you not know
that you have been hacked?

668
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,180
So I, my question will be, I mean, you
you've said you you've said so much about,

669
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,220
um, updating plugins and all of that.

670
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,230
What, how often should.

671
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:33,345
The company, I mean, maybe small
organizations who can't really afford

672
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:38,384
the retainer services or the hackers.

673
00:41:38,714 --> 00:41:41,265
How do they check?

674
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:45,435
You know, so is that, is that
a checklist or a timeline they

675
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:50,055
should check, um, security of dates
or functions of their websites?

676
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,595
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: It depends.

677
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:57,555
There are some people that just check
it daily, some say you can use, for

678
00:41:57,555 --> 00:42:01,694
example, this, site check to to check,
uh, if there's something wrong or you

679
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:04,995
have a hosting provider that makes these.

680
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,950
Performed these daily scans in your
website and so on, but it's nothing fixed.

681
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,750
It's something that's depending on you.

682
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,600
For me, it's important to
have a good maintenance and

683
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,950
a good maintenance includes.

684
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,430
For example, how to
have scan your website.

685
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,140
Eh, very often.

686
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,000
The faster, you, you, the detect,
these kind of things, the faster you

687
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,120
recover and the less harms, what I
always say, but, uh, for small companies

688
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:39,470
just using, for example,  site check
scanner, a have a Wordfence plugin

689
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,109
um, something like that.

690
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:47,029
If you are a skill enough, has
the WPSCAN running in your server?

691
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,570
It's  with that part, you, uh, Ready?

692
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:56,350
High, you have higher possibilities
to get the infection or intrusion,

693
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,860
or vulnerability a faster enough.

694
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:04,890
Michelle: Uh, Jenna had a question for
you from the  or from the, um, from the

695
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,480
chat there she says, would you recommend
storing a copy of the latest backup, both

696
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,730
in the cloud and on a physical device.

697
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,754
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: I think from
my point of view, this is a little bit,

698
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:20,055
uh, uh, depending on the person, right?

699
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:23,055
Of the need, that's the
needs of the company.

700
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:29,415
Uh, I recommend having it in the cloud,
not the physical device, uh, because

701
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:35,925
the, the physical device can just, uh,
You know, can get damaged, can get lost

702
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:39,345
or whatever on the end, if you get lost,
for example, you are sharing with others.

703
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:43,995
Uh, what happened even if you
have, for example, a NAS network

704
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:48,525
access, storage or something like
that in your, in your network.

705
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:54,065
If it got, if it get hacked, it gets
all information as well of the backups.

706
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:58,515
So I normally recommend, I prefer
to rely in a cloud services and

707
00:43:58,545 --> 00:44:00,955
this is my, my, from my part.

708
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:06,649
Truly, it's very redundant to have to
do this kind of backups, but it depends.

709
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,279
If you have a big company,
you have a lot of access.

710
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:10,910
It's very, very costly.

711
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,950
Uh, your needs to do assure
that they are working and.

712
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,709
So on you have in both places.

713
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,399
It's okay.

714
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,839
Michelle: Not too long ago.

715
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:22,529
I actually found one of the first
websites that I built on three

716
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,060
and a half inch floppy disks.

717
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:25,410
What do you think of that?

718
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,079
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte:
Floppy disks, come on?

719
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,729
How many, how many floppy disks?

720
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,270
Michelle: This for like four or five?

721
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,569
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Well, I
would say not to put your mobile phone

722
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:48,759
near to them, something like that
because the end is magnetized, right?

723
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,310
Michelle: Yeah.

724
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:51,450
Three and a half inch floppy.

725
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:56,140
It was I, yes, I'm old,
but also very funny.

726
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,149
It was from my classes 20 years ago.

727
00:44:59,065 --> 00:44:59,825
Yeah,

728
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:05,195
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Probably, if
we know about that, there are probably

729
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:09,035
people in the, in the audience that
they don't know actually, but the

730
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:14,214
floppy disks is what the problems
we had with those floppy disks.

731
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:16,355
Michelle: And you don't
know what they are.

732
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:16,895
Go Google.

733
00:45:17,065 --> 00:45:18,555
We're not going to explain any more.

734
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:22,815
Néstor Angulo de Ugarte: Yeah, for sure.

735
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,765
I remember the big ones.

736
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:28,005
The 3.5, not the dead second, 2.5.

737
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:28,785
Yeah.

738
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:31,215
Michelle: The five inch, five and
a half inch or five and a quarter.

739
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:35,865
Oh, that's so funny.
