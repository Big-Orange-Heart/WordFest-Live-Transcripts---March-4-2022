Nexcess: Oh great.

6
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,155
My website crashed.

7
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,590
I give up.

8

Don't give up on your dreams.

9
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,630

hard with Bluehost website.

25
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:04,865

Matt Graham: Welcome back
to WordFest, stage two.

35
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:06,105
Uh, they say that lightening
does not strike twice.

36
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:11,174
Well, I beg to differ because we have two
lightning talks that are coming up next.

37
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:16,065
Uh, so we're going to watch both and
then we'll do a live Q and A with the

38
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,954
presenters after we've watched them both

39
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:21,375
Rachel Winchester: So next you'll
see Nate Finch with, Wait, wuuut?

40
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,605
Where did my CMS go?.

41
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:26,475
Nate has been working
on the web since 2011.

42
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:30,855
He loves web development because
the perfect mix of problem solving,

43
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:35,105

https://strata.com, he helps build
serverless serverless integrations for

45
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,915
WordPress prior to joining Strattic.

46
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,545
Nate worked as VP of development at
thedigitalring.com where he spent

47
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:50,115
his time, uh, between where he
split his time between developing

48
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,965
websites and developing developers.

49
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,830
He spent the bulk of his career,
freelancing working with hundreds

50
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,580
of clients through platforms like
top tout, top tile and codeable,

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,800
and has even completed a brief
stint as a web engineer with 10up.

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,790
Nate collects master's degrees has

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,390
and cooking are his favorite activities.

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,030
He lives in Wisconsin with his
wonderful wife and two daughters.

56
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,989
Nate Finch: Okay, welcome to Wait, wuuut?

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,460
Where did my CMS go?

58
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,120
This is about adventures in
building a WordPress experience.

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,859
Even when WordPress isn't available.

60
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:33,150
You know, your clients or your customers
have gone jammy, let's say when you

61
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,060
hear things like we sell products,
why isn't our checkout working?

62
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,410
We use admin Ajax.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,370
Why doesn't that work?

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,890
My search box, just
redirects to the homepage.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,990
Our forms don't submit anymore.

66
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,220
My regex redirects.

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,320
Aren't redirecting our SEO tanked.

68
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,130
What's going on.

69
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,770
I thought all of this JAMstack
stuff was supposed to help.

70
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,340
Wait, why can't we fill in the blank?

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,180
Why can't we do this?

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,219
So, what are we talking about?

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,000
We're talking about static, WordPress,
headless, WordPress, decoupled, WordPress

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,380
JAMstack, WordPress, serverless,
WordPress hexagonal, and content

75
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,820
mesh and all of this other stuff.

76
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,320
Why do we even do this to ourselves?

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,620
Right.

78
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,719
Why do our customers ask for this?

79
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:10,950
Why do our clients ask for this?

80
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,990
Basically, we all want simplicity.

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,980
We all want speed.

82
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,400
We all want security and scalability
and probably a lot of other S words.

83
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,730
The way that we can get a lot
of this is through things like

84
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,280
decoupled or static or JAMstack.

85
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:27,065
WordPress or websites or web
application implementations.

86
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:27,365
Right.

87
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,575
They just want to know that
their site basically, isn't

88
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,165
going to fall over, get hacked.

89
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,205
They want to keep things
simple on their end.

90
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,185
They just, they just want
all of these us words.

91
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:36,485
Right?

92
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,255
How do we get these things?

93
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:38,525
Right?

94
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,195
There's, there's a lot of talk
about where we want to go static,

95
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,685
or we want to go head less or we
want to implement a jam stack.

96
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:44,900
Solution.

97
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,179
What, what are, what
are the solutions here?

98
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,239
So some folks so that some
providers are going to tell you,

99
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,340
Hey, don't worry about any of that.

100
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,370
You can just go static or
decoupled, headless real easily.

101
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,310
All you have to do is replace
all your plugins, your theme, et

102
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,989
cetera, with their party services.

103
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,140
And we'll start it guys, your
site, your contact forums, probably

104
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,979
aren't going to work your search.

105
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:04,669
Isn't going to work.

106
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:07,340
You're going to have to implement a
third party comment solution, et cetera.

107
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,690
But you know, it'll be fine.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,179
Or somebody is going to say,
Hey, don't even worry about it.

109
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,620
Just hire yourself a modern Java.

110
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,765
Okay, probably react developer
team to build you a headless

111
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:20,664
JAMstack decoupled, static, cool
application set up a CICT process.

112
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,135
Get yourself multiple environments.

113
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:25,555
Use our proprietary thingamajig
use, get for version control and

114
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:28,075
deployments and refactor your
WordPress beyond recognition.

115
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,815
So what the heck?

116
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,855
These aren't great options necessarily.

117
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,735
And I'm not saying that these are
bad solutions, but they just might

118
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,385
not be for every customer or client.

119
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:40,105
So when you're thinking about your
clients and your customers, what

120
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,664
are some good solutions for them?

121
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,885
In this whole JAMstack'y world.

122
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:44,215
Right?

123
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,795
So let's define some terms, right?

124
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,845
Let's look at headless decoupled,
static, and serverless and

125
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:51,925
see what this is all about.

126
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:52,525
Okay.

127
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,445
So what are we even talking about here?

128
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:58,615
This is a massive diagram that just
shows a bunch of overlap of all

129
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:01,405
these JAMstack terms that we're
talking about and throwing around.

130
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:01,675
Right.

131
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:02,965
So why are we.

132
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,430
Kind of presenting this
high level overview, right?

133
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:06,659
This is a quote.

134
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,740
I really like your problem.

135
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,520
Isn't the problem.

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,440
Your problem is how to
think about the problem.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,650
What we're doing here is just
getting ourselves a vocabulary,

138
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,800
getting ourselves a mental image
of what we're talking about here.

139
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,789
So hopefully this will all just help
you think about how you can implement

140
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,620
these solutions and when, and what
are the best solutions for you and

141
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,969
your clients to be implementing.

142
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,590
So let's define some terms.

143
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:32,205
Static is anything that can
be served from the CDN, right?

144
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:34,484
So you got your HTML and
your CSS and your JavaScript.

145
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,554
These types of files can
be served from a CDN.

146
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:40,304
The headless approach is something
that uses WordPress as a CMS,

147
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:41,864
but has a custom front end.

148
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,685
So it's probably JavaScript
and it's not a classic theme.

149
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,414
Like we think of in the sense of
like the template hierarchy, right.

150
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,674
And all of these PHP files.

151
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,354
Decoupled is going to be
something like the content mesh.

152
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:54,895
This is a term that gets be coined
and that uses multiple services,

153
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,104
multiple API APIs, and it takes
the idea and the approach of

154
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,994
using the best tool for the job.

155
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:04,635
Serverless is custom on demand,
scalable functions and services

156
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:06,195
that provide a dynamic experience.

157
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:10,155
So this is where, you know, the
whole that the, there is no cloud.

158
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,205
It's somebody else's computer.

159
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:12,615
This is where you're using.

160
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:17,685
On-demand kind of ad hoc functions as you
need them for as long as you need them.

161
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,995
This is something that
can be very scalable.

162
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,354
Be ready to go in an instant for you.

163
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:27,664
And then finally, JAMstack this term is
basically in my view, a philosophy and

164
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:29,195
approach to building sites and apps.

165
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,304
It's not an actual stack.

166
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:33,664
Like we think of the LAMP or the
LIMP stack or the MEAN stack or the

167
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:35,225
MERN stack or whatever other stack.

168
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,765
It's definitely more of an idea of how
to approach building websites, right?

169
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,135
With JavaScript, API and markup.

170
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,485
What are your options?

171
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,485
Let's go through and look at
a few different options here

172
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:46,385
for each of these, right?

173
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:47,105
So if.

174
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,095
Talking about static.

175
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:52,125
Basically the idea there is that
there is no WordPress, right.

176
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,585
There is no spoon WordPress isn't there.

177
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,975
You're just serving up HTML,
CSS and JavaScript files.

178
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:01,455
So WordPress could be used to load and
scrape the content, but it's not going

179
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:05,475
to be available for you to use on like an
admin Ajax query or something like that.

180
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:09,615
So you might also be able to use
classic plugins and themes with this,

181
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:12,825
but they may not work in a static
environment if they require real-time

182
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,255
PHP in real time, server and database.

183
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,550
Interactivity.

184
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,600
So things like search forums WooCommerce,
uh, learning management systems,

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,970
membership sites are probably not
going to work out of the box like

186
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,260
they would with regular WordPress.

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,150
And you could see these kinds of things,
uh, with like WP Static or Shifter or

188
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,000
some, some other providers or services
that make your WordPress sites static.

189
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,344
So with headless, you're going to
be using something probably like

190
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:40,935
Gatsby or Next or Frontity, something
maybe like Grid Some, Eleventy,

191
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:42,765
anything like that on your front end.

192
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,814
And WordPress is still probably
available for the front end to access.

193
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:50,065
So that means something like your
front end is going to live at something

194
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:54,435
like example.com, but your WordPress,
your actual WordPress install is gonna

195
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,949
be let's say at wp.example.com or
somewhere else completely different.

196
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:02,160
So you still get a lot of speed and
scalability without the theme or plugin

197
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,790
load if your WordPress site, or if
your WordPress, I should say is still

198
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,270
available to the public though, uh,
people can follow those API requests

199
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,150
that a headless site is making and still
try to get into your WordPress site.

200
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,780
That's okay though.

201
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,060
Uh, we'll talk about other
solutions for that later.

202
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,580
So this might require a build and that
could be a very short process, or it

203
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,090
could be a very long process, or you could
have an incremental build system set up.

204
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,060
You're also going to be able to
model data from things like custom

205
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,600
post types are built in post types,
advanced custom fields, and even

206
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,910
blocks plugins may still work as well.

207
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,650
That actually load things into your HTML
or that you are calling an end point for.

208
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,260
And then even a rest API end points.

209
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:42,095
WordPress and WP GraphQL
could also work for you there.

210
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,335
Examples would be the Rudy's dot com site.

211
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:49,355
That there's been a couple
of case studies on that.

212
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:54,814
And then as far as I understand that
WP Engine's Atlas, the idea of Atlas

213
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:57,635
is built on this kind of idea as
well as like a headless implement.

214
00:10:58,285 --> 00:10:59,425
Now we have decoupled.

215
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,655
So what is decoupled?

216
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:04,045
So the idea here is, like I was saying,
you're combining a lot of different

217
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:05,995
API APIs with this content mesh idea.

218
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,025
So there's other structured
content or other data coming

219
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:12,145
in besides just WordPress data
or just coming from WordPress.

220
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:12,415
Right.

221
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,935
So you can use other services for forms.

222
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,300
Uh, e-commerce and stuff like that.

223
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,390
You can use a CRM or anything like that.

224
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,520
You might already be doing something like
this, honestly, with things like MailChimp

225
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,130
or HubSpot, Shopify, uh, et cetera.

226
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,480
That's the idea is like you are using
these best of breed services for

227
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,970
your, uh, for your website, right?

228
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,120
So you might be pulling in like
this whole mesh of things already.

229
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,094
So examples of this, sometimes we don't
actually know what they are, especially

230
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:41,444
if they have a decoupled front end.

231
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:45,734
So things like NPM js.org, which
were, it was a human-made project.

232
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,844
Couldn't pull in things from WordPress,
but also things from the NPM repository.

233
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,474
And you can see that these decoupled
architectures allow for a lot of

234
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:55,395
different, uh, poll and stuff.

235
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,604
And this is just a, the visual,
there is just a list of a bunch of.

236
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,175
Decoupled CMS says that you could use.

237
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,775
So last thing to talk about is serverless
and it's probably serverless plus static,

238
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:09,845
but you also see serverless services that
include a traditional WordPress site.

239
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,075
So let's look at that.

240
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:15,275
So you use WordPress in this sense
for content management and then maybe.

241
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,690
The site static and shut down WordPress.

242
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,640
This is actually what we
do on Strattic, right?

243
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,100
So you can use these serverless
services to make your WordPress sites

244
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700
static and then shut down WordPress.

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,820
Then on top of that, because
you have access to all of these

246
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,740
serverless services, things like
AWS Lambda or Google, Google cloud

247
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,940
functions and stuff like that.

248
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,980
Um, and then also real time databases
available, uh, to these that are kind

249
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,510
of serverless and scale really well.

250
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,640
You can create services
to maintain as much.

251
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,979
WordPress functionality as possible.

252
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:51,949
So you can build services for forms,
submissions, search, SEO, media, and

253
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:57,109
email offloads, multiple language stuff,
like, you know, WPML to where you can

254
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,430
actually support that kind of thing.

255
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,550
You can also run a lot of optimizations,
like minifying code cache, optimizing.

256
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,100
Running things on a CDN, et cetera.

257
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,140
So examples of this are any site
that's run on static.com and plugins

258
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,240
like delicious brains offload suite.

259
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,120
So they're Offload S3
in their offload emails.

260
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,030
And then also things like
using Netlify functions.

261
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,300
Right?

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,380
So if you have a site on Netlify,
you're also potentially using

263
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,760
their Netlify functions to.

264
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,615
You know, handle API keys
or something like that.

265
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:31,845
So that's actually, like I said, what we
do at Strattic, where we build out static

266
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,435
first serverless WordPress integration.

267
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,165
So you don't actually have to
completely rebuild your site.

268
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:39,195
Of course, if you want
to, uh, you can do that.

269
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,245
Definitely get some advice.

270
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,234
And if you have any questions about
doing that, feel free to hit me up.

271
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,885
So what should I do?

272
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:45,635
What should you do?

273
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,724
What should we do for ourselves
when we're building our own personal

274
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:52,175
projects and which we do for clients
and customers and enterprise level

275
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,765
customers and everything like that?

276
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:56,285
The first thing that we want
to do is really have a mind

277
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,694
shift in paradigm shift, right?

278
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:01,415
We want to change the thought process
around building for WordPress and what's

279
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,305
possible for clients and everything.

280
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:06,385
The expansion of what's
possible is really, really cool.

281
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,505
We've talked about a lot of tools
that are just getting better.

282
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,194
A lot of frameworks, a lot of services
that are just getting better for

283
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:16,645
what we can build for ourselves
and for clients and customers.

284
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:19,194
This also creates a virtuous cycle, right?

285
00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:23,005
Uh, basically one of the things that
I like to say is the more WordPress

286
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:26,844
experience we support, the more we're able
to support other WordPress experiences.

287
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:27,175
Right?

288
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:29,094
So for example, if you build.

289
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:34,045
Um, you know, a demo site or something
like that, a proof of concept, and

290
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:39,415
you've got your headless site running
a, an XJS, you know, app, and then

291
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:43,675
it's hosted on Netlify and then you
have to figure out how to implement,

292
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:47,694
uh, gravity forms for a decoupled or
headless WordPress implementation.

293
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,125
Once you figure that.

294
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:53,905
You are thinking, probably going to think
to yourself, holy cow, I can do this for

295
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:57,324
a bunch of other services, a bunch of
other types of plugins that, you know,

296
00:14:57,324 --> 00:15:01,584
we can go ahead and use these kinds of
processes and serverless functions for.

297
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,704
So what we also see here is that
we ended up building more resilient

298
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:08,515
platforms when we start to employ these
kinds of tools at our disposal, right?

299
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:11,665
Whether we are building something
that's headless or static or.

300
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,630
Decoupled or kind of full
on serverless, right?

301
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,750
We have a more resilient platform
and charity majors have this great

302
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,710
quote on a podcast recently that
resiliency and reliability is not

303
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,480
about making your systems never fail.

304
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,060
It's about making them resilient
to lots of failures, right?

305
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,370
I usually like to say like, Hey,
we were on the internet and like,

306
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,360
nothing is a hundred percent.

307
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,805
So as we build things out and make
things more resilient and we offer

308
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:37,555
and cover more WordPress experience
right on these different, you know,

309
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:41,695
decoupled or serverless, uh, instances
or, uh, platforms and stuff like

310
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:47,635
that, then we're able to make sure
that the sites and applications

311
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:49,855
that we run don't fall over as much.

312
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:50,365
Right.

313
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,435
We're able to scale.

314
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:56,180
Uh, further, we're able to be
more secure, less vulnerable to

315
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,319
attacks and things like that.

316
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:00,560
So, uh, the more that we do this
kind of stuff, the more resilient

317
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,150
our platforms and our sites become.

318
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,760
So you might be saying, hold on,
just, just wait a second here.

319
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,060
This all sounds really great and
everything, and we could do all of this.

320
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,360
Right.

321
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,069
Um, but should we do that?

322
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,300
The good old Jeff Goldbloom
quote from Jurassic park, right?

323
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,189
We're so preoccupied with whether
or not you could, you didn't stop to

324
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:17,600
think if you should, again, before.

325
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,250
Take any of these approaches,
think about your clients.

326
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,080
Think about yourself, what
do you want to be managing?

327
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,940
What do you think they
want to be managing?

328
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,870
And especially this question here, if
you're hosting websites and managing

329
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,810
all this infrastructure for them,
what happens if they want to leave?

330
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,410
Right.

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,680
If they don't have you anymore,
they don't have your team anymore.

332
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,550
And this is just the story that when I was
working at a local agency, A few years,

333
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,010
I got super into this headless and jam
stack and implementing WordPress this way.

334
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,820
And I thought it was great.

335
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,840
Cause you got the speed.

336
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,030
You got the scalability,
you got the security there.

337
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,870
All of these things were fantastic, but
I sat down with one of the owners of the

338
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,650
agency and he's looked at me and he said,
but what happens when they want to leave?

339
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,110
And instead of staying
with us to where we host.

340
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,430
You know, WordPress and that whole
infrastructure and that we're doing

341
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,510
all the maintenance and stuff.

342
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,160
What happens when they want to leave?

343
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,109
Because they're not seeing
the value there anymore.

344
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,950
And they want to host on, you know, a $5
a month hosting, what do we do for them?

345
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,990
Then they don't have a
WordPress theme anymore.

346
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,040
They don't have maybe all the plugins
that they could use in like a regular

347
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,300
classic WordPress environment.

348
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,379
Now, what do we do?

349
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:22,790
Do we have to have a whole offloading.

350
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,400
Feed that they're going to pay
just to get their sight back,

351
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,630
that they spend all this money on.

352
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,920
Let's take care of them.

353
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,250
Right.

354
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,490
So whenever you know, you're thinking
about this, it's really great to

355
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,030
think about all the possibilities
and stuff, but it's also okay

356
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,530
to stick with classic WordPress.

357
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,720
There are a lot of big sites that do that.

358
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,190
CSS tricks.com, white house.gov,
and a lot more all still running

359
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,140
classic WordPress and still doing.

360
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:49,875
So you can be wanting to implement all
this great, cool new stuff, but you

361
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,535
know, think about your clients and your
customers as well, and that you are your

362
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,745
marketing agency or your company you're
going to have to manage all this stuff.

363
00:17:56,835 --> 00:18:00,195
I would end by saying that I
think this is so much fun, you

364
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,475
know, when you are dealing.

365
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:07,264
Uh, headless or a decoupled or a static
implementation of WordPress where

366
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,004
WordPress isn't even there anymore.

367
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,575
It can be hard and frustrating and
challenging, but it's also very rewarding.

368
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,165
It's really all the emotions.

369
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,745
And I would just say like, it's
really fun to build support for

370
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:19,925
something that in the end isn't even
actually there, I look forward to

371
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:23,465
answering any questions you have and
love talking about all that stuff.

372
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:24,605
Cause I think it's super exciting.

373
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:24,845
Thanks.

374
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,340
Matt Graham: Welcome back.

375
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:37,320
So we have, uh, both Nate and Rick
here to answer your questions.

376
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,750
Nate Finch: Hello.

377
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,900
Matt Graham: Awesome talks.

378
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,070
If they hit, they hit a chord,
obviously different courts with meaning.

379
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,900
Um, the last, uh, last eight months,
I've been kind of going through a tough

380
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,750
time with, uh, with my mental health,
but I was playing around with headless

381
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,250
WordPress, probably I wanna say six years.

382
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,770
I actually did it.

383
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,990
I actually did a talk, uh, in,
um, we're, uh, WordCamp Hamilton

384
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,720
about, uh, about doing a.

385
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:25,274
Um, using WordPress as like an
app development, uh, framework.

386
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,915
So yeah, what you're talking
about is really cool.

387
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:28,245
Yeah.

388
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:30,554
Nate Finch: That's fun, man.

389
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:34,885
That's a bit about too in that, uh,
uh, we're using WordPress for web apps

390
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:40,055
book came out, actually, I'm trying to
remember the guys at WebDev Studioes

391
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,284
Matt Graham: I haven't actually had
a chance to read that one over yet.

392
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,245
Rachel Winchester: I have a
question about how you first, uh,

393
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:49,965
I guess, got into JAMstack and
building static WordPress sites.

394
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:53,955
And really like when that
moment for you, when it clicked

395
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,455
that this is the way to build.

396
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,520
Nate Finch: Yeah, that's a great question.

397
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,379
Um, I think for me, at least I think
it's different for everybody, but when

398
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:08,940
you see, I think like, I don't know, I
grabbed a Gatsby theme first starter.

399
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,350
It wasn't a few, it was,
it started as before.

400
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,750
And it's like, you know, you, I think
you've just come out of, and they had

401
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,250
like the, uh, WordPress course, it
was really just like plug and go and

402
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,010
how easy it was to like get started.

403
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,875
Kind of get it going well, I don't know.

404
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:26,955
Easiest relative term.

405
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:27,615
Absolutely.

406
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:31,304
Um, so back it up a little bit
there, but like Netlify had their

407
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,844
free hosting still does, like
my personal site is still there.

408
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,415
And so you just like deploy it
and you're like, oh, that's there.

409
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,675
And it's just pulling all
this information from my site.

410
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:41,595
Well, that's cool.

411
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,405
And so the tools are there, you know, so I
think it was just like, kind of the right

412
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:50,175
moment when Gatsby kind of came along
and, uh, Netlify came along to really

413
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,575
have, uh, an easy way to get that up.

414
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:56,965
So I know there's other solutions now,
uh, through Vercel, through Strattic,

415
00:20:56,985 --> 00:21:01,754
through all sorts of like headless options
and stuff like that and static options.

416
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:02,825
And everything's.

417
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:06,705
Yeah, but I think for me, it was
just like seeing the speed and, you

418
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:09,854
know, Gatsby has the, um, what is it
called where you hover over a link

419
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:10,995
and it like, pre-loads the page.

420
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:14,715
So it was just like, just so fast
and the images look so crisp and

421
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:17,985
clean and there's just so little
that you have to do or whatever.

422
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,114
So, yeah, I was like, this is cool.

423
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:21,969
That was great.

424
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:22,989
Rachel Winchester: Nice.

425
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:27,459
I been getting into
JAMstack about a year now.

426
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:35,199
Um, but not as a developer WordPress,
um, and while getting into it, I've

427
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,879
been listening to so much heavy metal.

428
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:39,580
So I like how Rick.

429
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:46,705
To heavy metal and that people can
listen to whatever music that you like.

430
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:51,175
So I'm curious, what kind of music
do you listen to throughout your day?

431
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,254
What do you like to work to?

432
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:56,665
Rick Alday: Oh man, like my music
taste is really all over the place

433
00:21:56,665 --> 00:22:01,735
and um, you know, I, I can share
some way in my playlist and some

434
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:07,945
of them I'd rather than that, but
yeah, I mean, I just listened to.

435
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:13,425
Well, I'm working at drink to loosen,
to like some like low-fi music.

436
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:17,864
Uh, but again, it depends on
my mood and what I'm doing.

437
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:24,435
Uh, I definitely, you know, head
bang sometimes, and I have my

438
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,415
kid like working next to me.

439
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:33,254
She's taking a homeschool at moments,
or I cannot put out my music too loud.

440
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:39,480
I use my headphones and, but, um,
yeah, I mean, It depends on my mood.

441
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,740
So it varies quite a bit.

442
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,120
Matt Graham: Yeah.

443
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,060
So I guess speaking of variability,
what is that one thing that

444
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,980
you need to do every day to.

445
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:58,365
Yourself, like I want to stay sane,
but really the, the thing is focused.

446
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,915
What is that one thing
that you always need to do?

447
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:01,814
Rick Alday: Okay.

448
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:06,345
Um, what works for me is
taking a lot of breaks.

449
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,135
Like a lot of five minute breaks,
every 40 minutes every hour.

450
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:12,215
I need to just step out of the office and.

451
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,875
I just, just go, ah, what
are my plants and our yard?

452
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:19,155
And that's like, what I like to do.

453
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:24,225
I like to do gardening on my time
off and that just like completely,

454
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,635
completely just takes me away.

455
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,129
Any, uh, anything I'm working on online?

456
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:34,139
So, uh, one of my coworkers,
he lives in the near the woods.

457
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,110
He has like a large
property in South Carolina.

458
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,120
So, you know, he, he almost with the,
like coming to slack, I'm going to take

459
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,370
a walk in the woods and that was for him.

460
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,050
And so, yeah, but that's
something I need to do.

461
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,610
I need to go outside and look at
green style, look at plants, look

462
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,474
a flower, you know, But I do.

463
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:57,225
Rachel Winchester: Yeah.

464
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,514
I definitely understand that.

465
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:02,594
I think, uh, well, I don't know where,
where everyone's located in the world,

466
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:07,604
but where I am in the winter, you can't
get too much sunlight during the day.

467
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:13,304
So I have to leave and go outside
during lunch to even, get some sunlight.

468
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:19,004
Um, so yeah, I definitely, I definitely
feel that, um, going outside during

469
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,624
your work day and making a point of it.

470
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,780
Rick Alday: And just because I dunno, I
guess most of us work, you know, we're

471
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,350
sitting down all day, you know, working.

472
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,320
So just getting up, even getting,
you know, grabbing a cup of coffee

473
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,600
or just walking around like five
minutes, it really, you know, helps

474
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,489
you out with your back pain and,
you know, physically, mentally, it

475
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,709
just kind of resets you a little.

476
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:55,065
Rachel Winchester: Yeah, unless
you're too excited about the

477
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:59,145
develops develop the WordPress
static site that you're developing.

478
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:02,725
Nate Finch: I was actually the,

479
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,875
Matt Graham: yeah, that's the
question I wanted to ask you, Nate.

480
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:07,575
So I I'm a developer.

481
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,820
And I ha I feel like it could, I
don't know what it is, but I have this

482
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,550
rollercoaster of this is so cool too.

483
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,050
I hate this.

484
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,310
How do you go into that?

485
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,470
Nate Finch: Oh man.

486
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,159
Well, yeah.

487
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:23,860
And it's, it's also, you know, a
thing of like, oh, this is only

488
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,850
going to take me five more minutes.

489
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,240
I know.

490
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,980
And then five hours later,
you didn't go outside.

491
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,879
You didn't take your walk.

492
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:30,760
You didn't, you know, like say hi
to your family or something, working

493
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,070
at home or whatever and all that.

494
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,690
Um, yeah.

495
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:36,989
I don't know.

496
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,259
I'm still trying to figure that out
sometimes because I know that I'll,

497
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:43,559
you know, if I could I'd work like
all day and all night, and I just love

498
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,039
figuring all this stuff out is one of the
things I love about development, right.

499
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,729
Is that you're solving problems, like
figuring out puzzles and stuff like that.

500
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,919
So, um, yeah.

501
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:53,969
How do you deal with that?

502
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,929
I think like part of it is like, You know,
setting a timer for things, for sure.

503
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:00,720
Kind of like Rick was talking about,
you know, um, I think the other side

504
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,750
of it too, is to have multiple things
that you're trying to figure out, um,

505
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,830
that you're, or that, and if you have
other tasks you need to be doing that,

506
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:10,439
you're like, okay, I can only spend
like 30 more minutes on this before

507
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,760
I have to move on to something else.

508
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,679
And for me to like part, I was a
freelancer for, you know, six, seven

509
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,720
years or whatever, and joining a team,
uh, whether it's at a design agency

510
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,004
or now like Strattic where we're a
hosting company, um, You know, having

511
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:30,135
other people around you that have
those like have skills or can be your

512
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:34,605
rubber duck or, um, give you insight
and stuff like that to all that.

513
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,245
Like, if you can just like talk to
the people, like again, requisites

514
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:42,155
so much great advice, Rick,
that, uh, uh, it's super helpful.

515
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:45,074
Just feel like, figure those things
out and get unblocked and move forward.

516
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:52,004
You know, team like the sum, the total is
greater than the sum of its parts, right?

517
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:52,844
Yeah.

518
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:58,375
Matt Graham: Um, no, actually, uh,
AmyJune, which was one of the, uh, one of

519
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:04,225
the speakers earlier, uh, posted the, um,
the, from the developer Twitter account.

520
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:07,135
It's like, this'll just
be the five minutes fix.

521
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:10,155
Nate Finch: Yeah.

522
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:12,945
Five minute fixes every day.

523
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:13,995
Matt Graham: Yeah.

524
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:15,225
Right, exactly.

525
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:17,624
Right, right.

526
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:18,254
Exactly.

527
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:21,675
That's that's well, that's the limit
because if you go above that, then you

528
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,745
know, it ends up being an eight hour fix.

529
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:32,110
Rachel Winchester: Well, I, I
guess I have one more question.

530
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,540
Um, I'm curious, uh, w w with who
you deal with that at your job, um,

531
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:43,060
do people come to you excited about
static or do you have to convince them.

532
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:46,514
Nate Finch: Yeah.

533
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:51,375
So a lot of the folks that come to
Strattic are, you know, mid-size or

534
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,334
enterprise level folks that have been
running WordPress for years, and they

535
00:27:55,334 --> 00:28:01,334
have worked on other hosting platforms
with their hosting companies and they

536
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,469
there's like this kind of sweet spot
sweet spotat Strattic where we can

537
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:09,520
take your WordPress site as it is and
make it static and then put that out.

538
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,020
And we also like build in these
serverless integrations, like for gravity

539
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,979
forms or contact form seven, or need
WordPress search or the list goes on.

540
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:18,219
Right.

541
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,560
Um, but they have been.

542
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:24,284
I told that if they want to do
something static, something fast and

543
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:28,004
scalable and secure that they need
to rebuild their site and stuff.

544
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:32,235
Well, you know, they've spent years on
this or, you know, tens of thousands

545
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:37,185
of dollars or hundreds of thousands of
people, hours or whatever on the site that

546
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,685
they have in the set up that they have.

547
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:39,915
And their marketers love it.

548
00:28:40,004 --> 00:28:41,415
Their SEO, few people love it.

549
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,615
Their content writers love it.

550
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:43,725
They don't want to switch.

551
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:47,039
You know, a non WordPress
platform or whatever.

552
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:51,509
Uh, and they don't want to have like a
deployment, like a, uh, a build process

553
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,989
necessarily where they have everything
he coupled where there's like, you

554
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,319
know, next she has her Gatsby on the
front end and WordPress on the backend.

555
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,860
And they're still dealing with that
security then too, because they

556
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,919
still have their WordPress site
up and it could still be taxed.

557
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:07,589
The folks that come to us are
basically saying like, Hey, when

558
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,809
you shut down WordPress, that means
that our WordPress can't be hacked.

559
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:10,804
That's great.

560
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:15,304
And then you have all these awesome
integrations and stuff that other hosting

561
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:20,344
static hosting platforms or a static kind
of integrations don't have out of the box.

562
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:25,715
Like I said to the PML for like one
multinational site and stuff like that.

563
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:28,804
So those are the kinds of things
that are like really important and

564
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:30,965
like the headache, like we were
just talking with somebody else who

565
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,014
was like, you know, you all have.

566
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:35,355
Not to say that we cost somebody
their job or whatever, but it's like,

567
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:38,355
you know, if we were doing what we
were doing before we came to strata,

568
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:42,165
we'd still have another person and a
half or something like that on staff.

569
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:43,665
That's just, just watching our site.

570
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:43,965
Right.

571
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:47,534
Like they're not doing anything
productive or whatever, they're just

572
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,425
trying to help us with the thing.

573
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:50,925
So, yeah.

574
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:56,475
So yeah, it's, it's cool.

575
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:59,535
That's kind of the same story,
uh, you know, two dozen different

576
00:29:59,535 --> 00:30:00,615
ways and stuff like that.

577
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,184
Uh, come on.

578
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:03,679
Rachel Winchester: Yeah.

579
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:04,119
Yeah.

580
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,229
I'm very interested in, in, in,
um, how people are transitioning,

581
00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:11,579
because I know it's, it's, it's
kind of new or it's coming back.

582
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:16,529
Um, but it keeps trying to, uh,
to, to, you know, get even more

583
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,029
popular, which is really interesting.

584
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:19,109
Nate Finch: Yeah.

585
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:19,439
Right.

586
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:20,789
Yeah.

587
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,639
Everything's uh, that was old is
new again or something like that.

588
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:23,939
Right.

589
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,049
So.

590
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:28,799
Matt Graham: All right.
