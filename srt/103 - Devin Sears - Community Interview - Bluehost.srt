Take it away michelle.

00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:05,115

38
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:06,105
Good to see you.

39
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,955
Thanks for thinking both were
emceeing and Hey, there he is.

40
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,625
You tell him that he was in hair
and makeup still, but there he is.

41
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:13,905
Okay.

42
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:14,895
I'm going back to here.

43
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:16,605
Thanks.

44
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,850
Devin Sears: It was great.

45
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,520
Sadly, this is all they're able to do.

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,330
Michelle Frechette: I was going to say, I
just had to sit in the backseat of my car.

47
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:26,720
I don't know.

48
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:30,980
Devin Sears: I know.

49
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:31,250
There

50
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,580
Michelle Frechette: you go.

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,630
Right, for sure.

52
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,100
Well, thanks for joining me.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,720
Um, we, first of all, I was
so super excited to be able to

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,580
Bluehost as one of our sponsors.

55
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,755
But that meant that you and
I didn't have enough time to

56
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,435
actually prerecord our interview.

57
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:49,035
So we get to do it live, which is
actually, you know, kind of fun too.

58
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:51,345
So yeah.

59
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,085
Devin Sears: I'm doing good.

60
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:53,775
I'm doing good.

61
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,755
Uh, I'm based out of Austin.

62
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,305
Uh, I, I can never remember the UTC.

63
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:02,565
Uh, I think you and I share,
uh, Uh, difficulty with time

64
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,205
zones sometimes, but challenged.

65
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,695
Yeah, it's it.

66
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,305
Uh, the sun just went
down, but it was 75 today.

67
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,415
So it was a great day.

68
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:16,605
And, uh, I'm excited to be here happy
to be able to participate and to see

69
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:20,404
a lot of my friends across, across
the globe, even if it is virtual.

70
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,395
Michelle Frechette: Exactly it is nice.

71
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,955
And one of the nice things about, um,
what we can do with WordFest, because we

72
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:31,995
have the great sponsors, like Bluehost is
have those great community tents where you

73
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,245
can go in and like there's rooms already.

74
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,605
There are people kind of sitting,
waiting, and lots of opportunities

75
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:41,445
to talk to each other in between
sessions during the community time.

76
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,895
Um, and learn more, not only
about each other, but of course

77
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,094
our wonderful sponsors too.

78
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:48,735
So tell me a little bit about.

79
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,860
Was it, why did Bluehost
want to go ahead and sponsor?

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,320
Not just WordFest, but Big
Orange Heart for this year.

81
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,980
Tell me a little bit about your, um, your
desires to help out in the community.

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Devin Sears: Yeah.

83
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,120
Um, I think that Bluehost has always had a
desire to really engage with the community

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,830
and participate within the community.

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,300
And I think when, when we saw a Big
Orange Heart, putting us together

86
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,940
and we also participated last
year, we knew that we wanted to.

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,380
To, um, maintain our sponsorship
and maintain that relationship.

88
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,760
I think that the community is great.

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,020
Uh, I'm a big fan.

90
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,590
I've been a part of the
community for a while.

91
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,970
Now, a few years, we don't need to
go into how many, but it's, uh, I've,

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,870
I've developed lifelong friendships
outside of even my role at Bluehost.

93
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,850
And so I think that that's just
one small thing that contributes

94
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,320
to how important it is to.

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Find ways for us to interact with
each other, to learn from each

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,170
other, to help each other grow either
professionally or even personally.

97
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,960
I think, I think both of those
things are absolutely key.

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,250
So I think Bluehost participating
is, is one of the ways that we

99
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,670
can, we can help people connect.

100
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,900
Uh, I think one of the main Bluehost
missions is to help people tell

101
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,760
their story online, you know, We
try to implement as many tools as

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,710
possible to help people get their
site, their vision, their idea, their

103
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,810
e-commerce store, whatever it might be.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,460
We try to help them get that online.

105
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,190
And I feel like that's a way that
people can contribute their voice.

106
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,500
And I think specifically now when it's
not quite as easy for us to all socially

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,070
interact with each other, I think
it's important for us to find moments

108
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,450
like this event where we can all come
together and all kind of contribute

109
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,040
to our voices and raise each other.

110
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,890
Michelle Frechette: Yeah,
I couldn't agree more.

111
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,060
It's been, um, to say it's been a
trying couple of years for the WordPress

112
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,190
community is an understatement.

113
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,860
It's going to trying a couple of
years for all of us, for sure.

114
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,020
Um, regardless of what community we're in.

115
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,930
And, but when we're used to seeing
regularly, um, you know, like at WordCamps

116
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,000
and meetups and things like that, it's,
um, it's definitely been challenging,

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,470
but what I've noticed is companies
like Bluehost have taken opportunity.

118
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,295
To turn it around if you will.

119
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:20,445
So I have participated in more than
one Bluehost chat, um, but y'all have

120
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:23,415
on Twitter and that's just brilliant.

121
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:27,975
I love the fact the way that you kind
of rally the whole community around a

122
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:31,755
topic, but with, with questions, specific
questions that you ask, could you tell

123
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,145
us a little bit about, you know, what is
the Bluehost chat and why do you not do

124
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,615
it and how does it help the community?

125
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:37,980
Devin Sears: For sure.

126
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,210
Um, first of all, I would love to take
credit for it, but I cannot, that was,

127
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
that was our social media manager.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,900
So I want to give them credit.

129
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,230
Um, and second of all, thank you
so much for your participation.

130
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,180
I always am thrilled to see it.

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,070
When, when you participate, I do,
uh, sign into the Twitter handle and

132
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,800
I try to help reply when I can, um,
Twitter is not my forte, but, uh, I

133
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,550
do try to help out where I can, but
the, the idea behind the Twitter.

134
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:11,505
And the BHC hashtag BH chat is,
is the hashtag that we go with.

135
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,165
Um, it's, it's something that's short.

136
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:17,295
I feel like it's, it's very consumable.

137
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:21,915
You know, it only takes, I
don't know, 25 to 45 minutes,

138
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,865
usually on a Thursday afternoon.

139
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,965
Um, and I feel like we really wanted
to find a way to engage with the

140
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:33,585
community, bring the community together
and also have it be educational.

141
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,205
You know, we didn't.

142
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,495
As fun as it is.

143
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:39,674
And I know we all miss those hallway
conversations where we can catch

144
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:44,145
up and hear what Netflix shows were
bingeing, or, you know, how, how our

145
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,765
pets are doing or something like that.

146
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:52,395
Um, I think it's also important that we,
we maintain the ability to help each other

147
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:56,834
learn and to grow and to progress because
everyone in the WordPress community at

148
00:08:56,834 --> 00:09:01,005
one point installed their first WordPress
site, you know, and some of us remember.

149
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,420
Really well, you know, the, the, the
different questions that might've popped

150
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,830
up or the apprehension, you know, and the
fear that you had when you were trying

151
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,990
to navigate building your first website.

152
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,240
And on the flip side of that coin, a
lot of us also can remember the joy

153
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,830
and the happiness that we felt when we
stumbled across the community, or when

154
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,060
we were introduced to the community.

155
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,470
And we found there was this whole army of
people that have this wealth of knowledge.

156
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,535
That I could really benefit from, and
they're all so friendly and they're also

157
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:34,785
willing to reach out and to help me.

158
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:39,405
And so we, we wanted to try to
find a way that we could share

159
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:40,545
our knowledge with each other.

160
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:44,625
And when I say our, I mean, our as
the community, not our, as Bluehost

161
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,225
share the community's knowledge with
each other, help people that might be

162
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,975
looking for a fun way to interact and.

163
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,055
My my role.

164
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:56,565
I usually try to be the person
that responds with gifts.

165
00:09:56,595 --> 00:10:01,005
So if you ever participate and there's
a, a gift, that's usually my role.

166
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:06,435
I try to, I try to find fun ways
to respond and, and, uh, the,

167
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,805
the perfect gift as a response.

168
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:12,195
That's, that's my role in all
of that, but we've enjoyed it.

169
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,805
Michelle Frechette: I am the gif
queen when it comes to the BH chat.

170
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:17,955
Like I, don't not post an answer
without, without a gif because

171
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,725
there's so many really good ones, too.

172
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,775
Devin Sears: And, and I'm
a visual person as well.

173
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,495
So I think that's one of the reasons
why I'm not as good on Twitter.

174
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:30,325
Um, but replying with gifs.

175
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:34,064
And, and I feel like that really
brings a visual element in it.

176
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,645
I mean, to some degree it
tells like a small story.

177
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:36,915
Right.

178
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:42,105
And it just, I feel like it really, uh,
Really can convey the emotion or the,

179
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,515
or the point that you're trying to make.

180
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:45,765
And it always just makes it seem fun.

181
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,285
And it's always a little bit
of a goose chase to try to find

182
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:52,545
one that fits perfectly or is
relevant or is currently topical

183
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,135
or trending or something like that.

184
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:58,725
So there's a fine line.

185
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,075
You got to find that fine line.

186
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,955
Michelle Frechette: There are
some on there that are like a

187
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:07,635
little questionable, but I think
if you can make somebody smile.

188
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,125
In 280 characters or less plus a gif.

189
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:13,245
I mean, that's pretty awesome, right.

190
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,575
Especially if you're dropping some
knowledge that helps people, um,

191
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:20,595
move forward with their businesses
and with their websites for sure.

192
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:24,735
And that's one of the things I love
about the BH chats is it, isn't just

193
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,655
like, this is how you build a website.

194
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,615
These are what plugins are.

195
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,575
It's not like that, like the basic
building blocks of making a website.

196
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:35,355
It's the basic building blocks of
being successful with the website

197
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,815
that you build, which I think is.

198
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:38,835
Devin Sears: Yeah.

199
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:42,225
And we really try to crowdsource
our knowledge, which I think

200
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,835
kind of comes down to the heart
of the WordPress community.

201
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:47,835
In some degree, you know, it it's
crowdsourcing our knowledge and it's,

202
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,395
it's sharing it and receiving it.

203
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:49,525
And.

204
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:51,465
All at once.

205
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:57,195
You know, so I think, uh, I like to think
that that Bluehost has a few subject

206
00:11:57,195 --> 00:12:03,105
matter experts within its ranks, but
I also definitely recognize that there

207
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,945
is a wide plethora of people out there
within the WordPress community that

208
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:09,295
truly are the subject matter experts.

209
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:14,334
And so I think it reminds me a little
bit of those, like, uh, Forbes, like we

210
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:20,724
asked 50, uh, business millionaires or
whatever, you know, how, how they became

211
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,494
entrepreneurs or to tell their story.

212
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,254
And so I, I like to think of it kind
of like that, where it's like, okay,

213
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:28,464
well we want to turn this over to the
community and like, tell your story.

214
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:29,185
Like we help.

215
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,444
We want to help amplify your story as well
as educating people that are following.

216
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,230
Michelle Frechette: And it's great because
you do reach out to certain people.

217
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,349
I don't know how many, um, and ask
them to participate in advance so

218
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,700
that you kind of get that pump primed.

219
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,089
But so many other people join
into the conversation too.

220
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,020
So it isn't just like, uh, these people
on stage and everybody has to watch.

221
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,900
It's like, oh wow, this is
a really great conversation.

222
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,710
And everybody can be included and
everybody can put their 2 cents in and

223
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,000
everybody can learn from one another.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,470
So, yeah, it's brilliant.

225
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,639
You guys do a really great job with that.

226
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:01,990
Absolutely.

227
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,319
So what, what makes working at Bluehost,
um, a special place and how do you,

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,899
you know, as I've observed about
community and things like that, what

229
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,369
do you do for your own employees?

230
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,050
As far as mental wellbeing?

231
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,780
Devin Sears: Two-part question.

232
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,230
Um, let me go through the first one first.

233
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,869
Um, what makes working
at Bluehost special?

234
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,730
I'll answer for myself personally.

235
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,250
Um, I'm honestly going to say the
opportunity to participate and

236
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,409
engage with the WordPress community.

237
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,260
Um, if I'm completely honest, when I first
stepped into this role, I did not know

238
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,119
the friends I would make along the way.

239
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,780
I don't think any.

240
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,040
I could imagine that I didn't know
the different places it would take me.

241
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,879
I just kind of knew that I needed to get
some swag together and maybe a banner.

242
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,400
And I was going to go stand somewhere
in Miami by a table and try to make

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,339
some friends or, you know, try to
see if people were interested in

244
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,129
talking about Bluehost and little.

245
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,300
Did I know that that stepping into that
door, you know, I have friends all across

246
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:07,960
the country that you're just, just from
travel, some WordCamp US from WordCamp

247
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,470
Europe, all across the globe that, you
know, I'll pick up the phone and I'll

248
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,060
call someone and say, Hey, I just, I
haven't talked with you in a while.

249
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,510
I miss you.

250
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,280
And it's it's for me, it's, it's been
the friendship along the way, which I

251
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,530
know is, is kind of cliche, but it, but
it really is one of the main things that

252
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,280
I've loved about working at Bluehost's.

253
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,920
Not only the friends I've made within the
community, but the friends that I've made

254
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,950
among my coworkers and my peers as well.

255
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,940
The second part of the question
is what does Bluehost do about

256
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,010
remote working and mental health?

257
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,790
Was that was that

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,349
Michelle Frechette: Yeah, talk about
mental wellbeing with your employees?

259
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,250
Um,

260
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:53,280
Devin Sears: I think there's a, there's
a big push for people to take care of

261
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,230
themselves, uh, and their mental health.

262
00:14:56,355 --> 00:15:01,454
Um, I know, kind of culturally, we, we
try to have a little bit of water cooler

263
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,224
chitchat, somewhere along the meeting.

264
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:09,314
I know that with zoom meetings and with
online virtual meetings, it's really,

265
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:12,675
really easy for people to come into
the meeting, talk about the business

266
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:16,334
and then hang up when you're done,
you know, there's you, you lose that.

267
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:19,605
Hey, as we're walking back to our
desks, like tell me about your weekend.

268
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:19,905
Like we can.

269
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:24,044
Take a step away from the business
side of things, just as we're walking

270
00:15:24,044 --> 00:15:27,615
back to our desk or let's, you know,
go out and grab a bite of lunch

271
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:28,814
together or something like that.

272
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:33,014
You really don't have those opportunities
that you, that you had, uh, when

273
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:34,875
you worked in an office space.

274
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:39,405
And I think that Bluehost is,
has been great at promoting and

275
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,665
finding those opportunities.

276
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:42,255
Say okay.

277
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,675
You know, like before we get
started, how's everyone doing?

278
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:46,845
You know, I haven't seen you in a while.

279
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,175
How's how's your kid, or, you know,
like, I know you have this house project

280
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:54,105
you're working on, what's going on
with that, you know, and, and, and

281
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:58,905
really making an effort to strengthen
those relationships beyond just the,

282
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:01,815
Hey, your, the email channel manager.

283
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:06,525
I need you to email, you know, I
need you to, to manage this channel.

284
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:10,395
Like it's, I think viewing
people as people, instead of.

285
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:14,355
Tools in a, in a tool chest is
something that they've done a really

286
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,994
good job at doing on top of that.

287
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:22,125
They also try to schedule, uh, events
on a regular basis and sadly, I'm

288
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,675
not able to attend all of them,
but I attend as many as I can.

289
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:29,355
Most recently we had a marketing
Valentines Olympics, so it was

290
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:32,685
a combination in February of a
Valentine's and the Olympics.

291
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:37,125
Um, we set aside, I think it was
an hour and a half or so, and

292
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:41,355
everyone from marketing jumped on
the same call and, and they, they

293
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,915
had breakout rooms and everything.

294
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,675
So you could get to know some people
that maybe you didn't know before

295
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,865
they had awards, they had games.

296
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,444
Um, so it was, it was a lot of fun.

297
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,314
It really was.

298
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:57,554
Uh, and in addition, uh, they also have
employee resource groups or affinity

299
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:04,080
groups, so they have, um, Uh, I say they,
we, I guess, uh, I say they, because

300
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,210
I don't personally contribute to that.

301
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,450
So I don't, I don't want to take
credit for someone else's, uh, hard

302
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,680
work, but Bluehost provides its
employees with, uh, an affinity group.

303
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,980
Um, one that comes to mind
is the thrive affinity group.

304
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,690
And they host regular breathing
exercises and meditations where

305
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,790
anyone can join and participate.

306
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,740
And, uh, they have a focus on the, the
mental health and mental wellbeing.

307
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,765
Any employee that feels like they need a
little bit of a boost or a pick me up or

308
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:35,775
just want to be involved with that group.

309
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:37,155
Michelle Frechette: Wow.

310
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:37,785
That's great.

311
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:44,925
Well, I can't talk about Bluehost without
also bringing up two very specific things.

312
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,845
So I have two more questions.

313
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,720
One, how many games of Mario cart
have you played over the years since

314
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,210
you've been part of the post and two,
how many big screen TVs have you not

315
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,950
given away in the last three years?

316
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,010
Devin Sears: Oh man,
that's a great question.

317
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,389
Games of Mario kart.

318
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,669
I don't, we've played so many
games of Mario kart, uh, for,

319
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,510
to clue in the audience that
might not be aware, uh, Bluehost.

320
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,300
Traditionally, when we have an
in-person event, we will buy a.

321
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,640
Large TV locally.

322
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,680
And we bring with us and
Nintendo 64 and Mario kart 64.

323
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,010
And so usually on the first day
of the event, we'll demonstrate

324
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,740
a Bluehost product or the newest
features that we're working on.

325
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,360
But then day two, we'll, we'll break out
the Nintendo 64 and, and attendees that

326
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,740
are looking for a quick five minute break
and stop by and race and things like that.

327
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,120
And just over the years, after
going to as many events as I have.

328
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,600
I have played a lot of Mario
kart, um, to the point where we

329
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,389
have discovered if everyone ties.

330
00:18:54,389 --> 00:19:00,659
So if you do like a four race circuit
and everyone ties, we had discovered

331
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:08,639
that the game prioritizes who wins
by the, the controller position,

332
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,159
like where you've plugged in your
controller, if you plugged in his player,

333
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,040
That's prioritized so that you win.

334
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,380
So I've paid enough to do
all of these very weird tests

335
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,600
unintentionally just over the years.

336
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,880
But, uh, I would also like to take
this opportunity to plug, uh, the

337
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,220
Bluehost's booth here during WordFest.

338
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,970
Obviously we don't have an intendant 64.

339
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,060
We're not able to give away a TV, sadly.

340
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,590
Um, but tomorrow, depending
on when you're tuning in.

341
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:46,995
Tomorrow, we are going to
have an hour in our booth that

342
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,254
we're calling, switch it up.

343
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,425
And anyone that has an Nintendo
switch, if you like, you can stop

344
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:56,925
by, uh, share your game code, make
a new friend within the community,

345
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:59,445
and we'll be doing some Mario kart.

346
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,995
If people want to, you know,
we're, we're there to play whatever

347
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,794
game that that you want to do.

348
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:07,185
So, uh, there's still some more
Meyer card to be played for.

349
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:10,425
Michelle Frechette: Um, I played
Mario kart twice in my life.

350
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:14,145
My daughter, she was in her late teens
and early twenties at the time she brought

351
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,825
it over just to see how I would do.

352
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,385
I am terrible at it.

353
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:21,645
And she laughs because I always like
move my whole body what I'm trying to.

354
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:22,274
Yeah.

355
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:22,455
So.

356
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,630
I do that when I watched the luge, um,
like, and skiers in the Olympics too.

357
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,480
So I just, I think, I guess
maybe if I leave, I'm going

358
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,290
to help them a little bit.

359
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,890
I don't know.

360
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,290
Devin Sears: I'm going
to tell you something.

361
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,410
I think you're actually ahead of the
curve because with the emergence of

362
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,400
virtual reality, I feel like that's
how a lot of the games are played.

363
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,600
I feel like it's with the leaning
and the head tilting and all of that.

364
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,640
So I think you are just a savant.

365
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,830
I think you were ahead of your time.

366
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,750
You were just ready for
the virtual reality.

367
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,090
Michelle Frechette: Can you
text that to my daughter?

368
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
Let her know that I am.

369
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,020
I am a head of the head of the well Devin.

370
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,810
I'm going to go ahead and wrap it
up so you can say hi to people.

371
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,940
Uh, I don't know what
your whole plans are.

372
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,860
I hope that you're going over
to your booth for a few minutes.

373
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,510
After this case, everybody wants to say.

374
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,500
And I know that you're probably
going to take some time to sleep

375
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,050
tonight before you show up before
you come back to the, with tomorrow.

376
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,330
But, um, AF after we sign off here,
go over to the community tent, see the

377
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,520
Bluehost table, say hello to Devin, Devin.

380
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:32,315

has provided, so that Big Orange

Heart can do the work that we do
in the community, which is reducing

382
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:39,275
those feelings of isolation for
people in the remote work community.

383
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,015
So thank you so much for being here.

384
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:42,785
