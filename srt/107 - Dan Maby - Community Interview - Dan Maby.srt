36
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:08,454
Yogesh Londhe: Welcome again to Asia
stage one and we are in session 1 0 7.

37
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:14,815
Joining us live now is Dan Maby
himself, not maybe himself.

38
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:15,385
He is.

39
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,585
But yeah, maybe it's the name.

40
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:19,065
Okay.

41
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:25,965
So Dan is our lead WordFest organizer
and director of Big Orange Heart.

42
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:33,375
This WordFest, we are taking some
time to get to know our organizers and

43
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:36,015
why they volunteer for this huge job.

44
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,185
Why do they give so much time?

45
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,110
What they do when they are not,
uh, WordFest'ing, and to learn

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,010
a little bit more about the
person, the human who is Dan Maby.

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:48,900
Okay.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,920

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,980

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,910
Hello.

52
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,380
Yogesh Londhe: This is the session

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,089
And I'm lucky enough to be here in person.

54
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,130
So Dan, maybe himself.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,700
So he is himself, but Dan Maby

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,750
Dan, we've got few questions
for you, but not enough time.

57
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,830
Sure.

58
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,690
Thank you very much.

59
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,710
Thank you very much for doing this
WordFest and thank you very much for.

60
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,205
Dan Maby: Yeah, you're very, very welcome.

61
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:36,385
And, uh, and did just wanna say thank
you both  for giving your time and

62
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,364
equally across, across this events.

63
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,835
There are obviously, we've got
some of these 108 volunteer roles

64
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:47,094
that are being filled just during
that 28 to 24 hour period to us.

65
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:47,994
We're delivering this event.

66
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:51,655
So a huge thank you to
everybody that's involved, uh,

67
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:52,765
across, uh, across WordPress.

68
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,114
Does that mean that

69
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,835
Yogesh Londhe: they say that, uh,
find the cause and means we'll follow

70
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,375
a good cause people do come to it.

71
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:02,724
Dan Maby: Absolutely.

72
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,784
Uh, let's let's start
with the questions then.

73
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,705
Um, so much to learn about you.

74
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,700
What do you, what, what
is Dan's role in WordFest?

75
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,620
What does Dan do and WordFest?

76
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:21,030
Um, I, if I'm honest, come up with lots of
silly ideas and then try and find people

77
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,859
that will bring those ideas to reality.

78
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,409
So, um, my, so my official role across
WordPress Fest live is a lead organizer.

79
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,659
Uh, so essentially, uh, ensuring that
we've got the teams in the right places,

80
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:36,390
individuals, you know, making sure that
individuals understand what they are.

81
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:42,424
That tasks they're undertaking and
basically supporting the team leads.

82
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,494
So we have a number of
teams across word Fest.

83
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:48,335
We have our speakers teams, our
marketing teams, our DevOps, uh,

84
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:51,275
there's AV teams, our sponsors teams.

85
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,835
There's, there's quite a number of them.

86
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:59,705
And basically, um, the, the idea of, uh,
for me, is to ensure that each team leads.

87
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:01,914
Is supported.

88
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,635
And I want to make sure that
every role is supported in a

89
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,224
way that's, uh, that is needed.

90
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:13,315
Making sure that the mission of Big Orange
Heart is fulfilled all the way through,

91
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,655
um, the delivery of WordFest Live.

92
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,414
Obviously with our mission being
to support and promote positive

93
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:21,175
wellbeing and mental health
within remote working communities.

94
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:27,145
Uh, and the idea of delivering an event
of this scale across a 24 hour period.

95
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:31,655
With any of such a huge
global audience there is.

96
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:31,835
Yeah.

97
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:37,835
There's the potential for, uh, for,
for, um, stressful situations, stressful

98
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,424
scenarios to start to creep in.

99
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:43,504
We, of course, that's, that's the last
thing that we want to be creating as

100
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,414
a, you know, as a, as an organization
that's focused on wellbeing.

101
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:50,104
Um, we need to make sure that this,
you know, this, this, uh, delivery

102
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,914
of this event is taken undertaken
in such a way that it really doesn't

103
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,835
have a negative impact on the
community that are delivering it.

104
00:06:58,934 --> 00:06:59,905
Yogesh Londhe: Thank you very much.

105
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:05,875
Uh, uh, you know, WordFest always makes
me happy and it, you know, it always has

106
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,725
a very positive impact on the community,

107
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,605
so, you know.

108
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:12,385
Okay.

109
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,155
So Lax next question?

110
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:15,475
Uh, yeah.

111
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:16,285
Lax Mariappan: So next question.

112
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,955
Why do you think events
like WordFest is important?

113
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,140
Dan Maby: So that is a great question.

114
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,199
And I think we're in this, um, we're
certainly in a transitional period,

115
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,419
I would say, uh, we've obviously had
an incredibly challenging couple of

116
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,679
years to say the very least there's
been an awful lot of, um, change that

117
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:42,789
we've had to adapt to an awful lot of
things that we've had to, um, overcome.

118
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,190
Uh, both, you know, for, for, for many,
many reasons, but, um, obviously not

119
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,890
least the fact that as a community,
we've not been able to truly be together.

120
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,599
And the, if we specifically talk about
the WordPress community for a minute,

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,539
I think the WordPress community.

122
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,089
Very very kind of bound around the people.

123
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,749
And it's a very special community
is a community that I've

124
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,609
absolutely fell in love with.

125
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,619
I've spent a long time within, and really
we wanted to deliver something that

126
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:19,479
could enable people to come together
and create some semblance of that

127
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,519
community spirit whilst coming together.

128
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,280
Trying to, you know, there's been lots of
attempts around delivering virtual events

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,300
and there, there are a lot of challenges
in relation to it, but really we want

130
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,460
to be creating a scenario where it feels
very community driven and it's about the

131
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,500
community that's delivering the event.

132
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,980
And it's about that, that same feel that
I think we can, we do get in our in-person

133
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,230
or physical events, which we have
obviously been lacking for for some time.

134
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:55,149
Um, so it's about bringing the
community together, creating an

135
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,470
environment where the community
truly feels part of the event.

136
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,839
Uh, but also making sure that we are
creating an environment where our

137
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,290
community members can come together
and we're, you know, we're reducing

138
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,639
that ability, you know, that, um,
impact that social isolation can have.

139
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,699
Uh, if we're in an environment
where we can't physically come in,

140
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,155
Yogesh Londhe: Thank you
very much for doing this.

141
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:25,825
And, uh, I think, uh, you know, if,
uh, you should put this question to.

142
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,915
Let them come up with the short clip.

143
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:34,044
I'm sure if you allow me Topher,
Michelle, to talk about this,

144
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,115
we could talk for a few days.

145
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,565
Why this, why, WordFest?

146
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,115
Why, WordFest is important?

147
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:39,395
Yep.

148
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:39,595
Yep.

149
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:40,024
Dan Maby: Yeah.

150
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:40,764
Okay.

151
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:45,784
So Yogesh if you'll allow me, why, why
do you, what is for you interesting?

152
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,825
It's interesting to hear what is,
what is the importance of WordFest?

153
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:50,095
Yogesh Londhe: Yeah.

154
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:55,165
So some of the, the first thing will
overlap with what to say, you know,

155
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,115
WordFest brings people together.

156
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:03,145
It makes people, you know, the, the
social contact, the feeling of community

157
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,974
coming together, learning from each other.

158
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,224
And it's not only learning.

159
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:12,234
It's about, uh, mental health, the
very important issue, especially in

160
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,514
this stressful time in last two years.

161
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,994
And we don't know what's going
to in this uncertain time.

162
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,750
Uh, you know, coming together
and meeting people, you know, uh,

163
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,339
contacting with people you still
don't know and making new connections.

164
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,129
And on top of that, learning new
things about, uh, what, WordPress

165
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,579
and the best part is it's it's,
uh, goes around the world.

166
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,290
So it's truly globally event.

167
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,135
It brings the world together.

168
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:44,694
It's uh, you can choose what
session you want to join.

169
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,314
What, where do you want to go?

170
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:51,895
And so it really brings the world, the
whole global purpose community together.

171
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:52,464
Yep.

172
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:53,665
Very important.

173
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,834
Thank you very much for doing this.

174
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:57,774
Dan Maby: You're very welcome and safe.

175
00:10:57,915 --> 00:11:00,054
It's a community, a
community driven thing.

176
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:05,034
So, um, you know, across the
board that, uh, I just, I just

177
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,804
feel it's, it's wonderful to see.

178
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:11,810
So, um, if you are a participantin
WordFest Live right now.

179
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,310
Um, there are, you know, there's a,
there's a great opportunity around

180
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,980
the, the, you know, the venue fever
to connect with people, head over to

181
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,780
the community tent, spend time, spend
time with the, uh, with the community,

182
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,339
jump on a table, jump in there with
the sponsors, uh, you know, just simply

183
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,649
connect with, with the community again.

184
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,470
But it's not just about that.

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,500
Um, something that I really,
really enjoy seeing is the way.

186
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:43,385
Across, for example, across our
slack community, the way everybody

187
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:45,964
supports one another in their roles.

188
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:48,665
And it's just wonderful to see
how people can just really step

189
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,994
up and, you know, w we're getting
volunteers answering questions for

190
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,335
volunteers, and it's just a really.

191
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,339
Special kind of, um, uh, a
community bond, I guess, uh,

192
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,720
that we, that we see across this.

193
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,500
And it's lovely.

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,440
Usually we see the screenshot people
taking photos of, you know, their

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,720
environment and how they're enjoying
WordFest Live and just creating those

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,230
little moments and, um, you know,
jumping over to the, the photo booth,

197
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,349
getting it, getting a little photo
snaps and obviously sharing that across

198
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,510
the social, all these little things.

199
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,960
I think they just add up to what often
becomes quite a, quite a special thing.

200
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,069
Yogesh Londhe: Sure, sure.

201
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:27,595
Lax Mariappan: To add to your question.

202
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:31,165
It's like, uh, I'd like to share
my experience with WordFest so far.

203
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:37,314
So last year is my first time to
attend the WordFest and that time

204
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:42,685
I had my first anxiety attack just
a few days ago and I was there.

205
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:46,494
I was recording my Udemy
courses with my girlfriend.

206
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:47,484
Got stuck in a quadrant.

207
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,005
Like she had to stay away.

208
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:53,785
And I was actually, I'm the
only person in that apartment.

209
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,595
So it's like mentally, I couldn't
go out as well because of, you know,

210
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:00,835
people consider that I'm exposed
to the virus, something like that.

211
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:04,165
So it's like, it was literally,
it was too anxious in nervous

212
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:07,320
or um, I'm a talkative person.

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,810
I never been alone or
I'm not used to that one.

214
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,260
And luckily I was like,
oh, WordFest I seen that.

215
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,280
Like, I was like, okay.

216
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,790
I just thought like, it's another
WordPress event like WordPress has a

217
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,410
lot of communities, a lot of things.

218
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,800
And then.

219
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:21,704
And I joined it.

220
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:25,814
I mean, it was just joined as a
participant and I visited, um,

221
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,255
all the attended all the sessions.

222
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,775
And then I visited the tents in, uh, I
chat with, uh, one of the sponsors like

223
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,964
Elementor group and other groups as well.

224
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:36,584
I saw Yoast community as well.

225
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:39,944
They have had this, like you
said, the sponsorships and.

226
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,165
Giveaways and games.

227
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,194
And also what not, like you can
ask any question about Yoast.

228
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:47,415
You can ask any question about
Elementor and things like that.

229
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:51,975
And, and also you get to meet other
people as well in the community chat.

230
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,275
So it's like, I spent
almost the whole day.

231
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,970
It was not an hour long shifts,
so that's my experience.

232
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,800
And that's how I was like, oh, okay.

233
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,850
So it helps that that's, that's
kind of the day I discovered like

234
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
being with people, like being with
like-minded people really helps.

235
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,170
And also I was also able to
answer some of the questions

236
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,730
of other participants as well.

237
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,470
So that helped me like, okay.

238
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,980
I also like to overcome my
imposter syndrome and other stuff.

239
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,120
Dan Maby: Sure.

240
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,450
Yeah.

241
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,680
Lax Thank you though.

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,830
I mean, that is that that's wonderful
to hear because essentially that's

243
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,970
what we're looking to achieve here.

244
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,030
The ability to, for people to
come together, uh, come together

245
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,030
as a community, uh, connect
with one another and you know,

246
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,640
there, I've got some, um, really.

247
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,410
Uh, I would say I'm really blessed to be
able to say that off the back of working

248
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,459
with a number of the, um, the, the
core team members, uh, across waitress

249
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,500
life, I've got friends for life here.

250
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:51,640
Um, and you know, it really is about,
you know, building up, how do we,

251
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,260
um, you know, make sure that we are
supported, uh, you know, between, you

252
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,939
know, with one another, um, that is
ultimately what Big Orange Heart is.

253
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,229
You know, we, we're trying to ensure
that we are, uh, enabling positive.

254
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:11,705
Uh, positive focus around wellbeing
and mental health for our community,

255
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:12,995
our remote working community.

256
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:18,245
So these opportunities to deliver these
events where we can come together,

257
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,075
that really a key focus for us.

258
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:24,595
Uh, something I did want to just
mention that, um, you know, Pushing

259
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:28,705
forward and we will be building
out, uh, through throughout 2022.

260
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,015
Uh, thanks to our global sponsors.

261
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,785
And I just want to quickly say a thank
you to Bluehost, Cloudways, GoDaddy

262
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:39,325
Pro, Nexcess, Weglot and Yoast for
coming on board as global sponsors.

263
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:44,420
They are actually enabling us to
build out our LifeGroup program.

264
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,849
So this is an exciting program
that we're going to be bringing.

265
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,859
Uh, we're going to be expanding upon.

266
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:51,110
We've already been delivering
it within Big Orange Heart.

267
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,240
It's something that's been
tested for some time now.

268
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,209
And we're looking forward to bringing
that into the community, which again

269
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,569
is an opportunity for community
members really to come together

270
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,219
and, uh, and to support one another.

271
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
So we simply couldn't do it without
the, the, you know, the financial

272
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,979
support that these companies provide.

273
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,545
Uh, but equally we are incredibly
grateful for every single penny that

274
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:14,795
is donated, uh, by the general public.

275
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,814
Uh, and again, if you're, if you're,
uh, here on WordFest Live and

276
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:21,755
you'll, you're gaining any benefit,
you're taking something away.

277
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:25,295
If you have the ability to, uh,
we would really appreciate it.

278
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,995
If you could hit the donate
now button in the menu.

279
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,369
Um, but I also know that I can
keep talking for a very long

280
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:35,160
time and we've got some far more
important sessions coming up.

281
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,869
Yogesh Londhe: So yeah, let's, let's,
let's take this last two minutes

282
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,719
to talk about, uh, Dan, the human.

283
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:43,499
Okay.

00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,339

Okay.

And I'm surprised you actually can't hear
him snoring away down in the corner here.

297
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:13,014
I've got a three year old Beagle
asleep in the corner here.

298
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,715

Yeah, my, my I've got a, an ever, um, ever

302
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,634
supports me tremendously through this.

303
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,284
And the fact that we're sitting here.

304
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:33,165
Yeah, absolutely.

305
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,395
For me, I mean, we're sitting here
at 5:00 AM in the morning for me.

306
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:41,804
She, so she's sleeping in the, in
the room next door and, you know,

307
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,165
uh, I'm just, I wouldn't be able to
do what I do if it wasn't for the

308
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,214
support network that I had around me.

309
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:49,764
Yogesh Londhe: Thank you.

310
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,420
Also, I connect with anybody
who has a four legged family.

311
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,340
I live with a lot of pets.

312
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,090
Yes.

313
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,580
I got like 20 dogs and 30 odd cats
and so many other wild animals yet.

314
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:03,659
Okay.

315
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,940
So.

316
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,520
Uh, what would, other than
WordFest, what other ways do you

317
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,380
contribute to what this community?

318
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,770
Dan Maby: Uh, so we've, I've been
running events for a very long time.

319
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,190
Uh, so obviously pre a near we're
going back more than a decade

320
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,100
now in terms of delivery of,
uh, in-person physical events.

321
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,969
Um, and.

322
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,935
I'm very community focused for me.

323
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:29,895
It's about the people.

324
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,324
Um, you know, we, we often hear it.

325
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,215
You came for the tech and
stayed for the people.

326
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,725
Uh, it's a bit of, a bit of a cliche,
but it absolutely is true for myself.

327
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:42,884
Um, you know, the, the moment I
stepped into a meetup, I was hooked.

328
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:46,165
I then went from the meetup
