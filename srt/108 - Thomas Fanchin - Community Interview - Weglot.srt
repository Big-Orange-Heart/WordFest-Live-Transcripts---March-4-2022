00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:16,115
they are committed to the WordPress
community and Big Orange Heart.

38
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:17,955
Emily Hunkler: Hello.

39
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:21,255
We are here for a community
interview with one of, uh, Big

40
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,875
Orange Heart's sponsors Weglot.

41
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:26,715
So we're very excited today to have
Thomas Fanchin  here with us as

42
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:29,475
the partnership manager for, Weglot
thank you, Thomas, for joining us.

43
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,195
It's great to see you.

44
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:31,125
Thomas Fenchin: Just so much.

45
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,325
Emily Hunkler: Wonderful.

46
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,645
Yeah, let's jump right into it.

47
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:37,575
So, um, can you talk a little
bit about Weglot and how

48
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,105
community is important to them?

49
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,695
What community means to you all.

50
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:41,910
Thomas Fenchin: Sure.

51
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,750
I mean, originally, uh, Weglot was
lunch during WordCamp Paris in 2016, 16.

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,079
Sorry.

53
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,040
So, um, I mean, since then we have
supported a lot of WordCamps, meetups,

54
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,300
but I've met a lot of friends who,
uh, uh, for community and also like a

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,160
lot of partners and great connection.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,720
And they also help us with
giving us great feedback.

57
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:16,464
Um, which help  to be, to try, I
mean, at least to build a, one of

58
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,034
the best multilingual plugin that
it's available to be on WordPress.

59
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:26,935
And I mean, it's kind of a, a, it's
really part of our DNA and it's kind

60
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:30,025
of an extension of, Weglot really.

61
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,215
Emily Hunkler: Yeah, absolutely.

62
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,235
That I think that makes sense.

63
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:37,854
And it is so important to remind
people, um, that community is

64
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:41,895
about connecting for one part and
also about connections, right?

65
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:45,914
Like creating those relationships and
nurturing them and exposing yourself

66
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:49,905
to new ones and helping them not only
grow yourself, but grow your business,

67
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,914
that open doors for you and all of that.

68
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:52,905
It's, it's huge.

69
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:53,895
Yeah, absolutely.

70
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:58,094
Um, what are some ways that
Weglot that you helped nurture a

71
00:04:58,094 --> 00:04:59,525
sense of community internatlly?

72
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:03,525
Thomas Fenchin: So that's a, uh, a
really interesting question actually.

73
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:09,705
Uh, I, I think within the team, we
do a lot of team meetings and we have

74
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:13,995
like project feedback, for example,
where everyone can join us and,

75
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:19,935
uh, give us feedbacks about how we
would like a project, whoever you

76
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:23,865
also have, like learning session,
where, uh, you can learn about, for

77
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,875
example, partnership in community.

78
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:29,690
You can learn about WordPress
integration and you can learn

79
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,429
about empathy, for example.

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,940
So I believe, uh, uh, this is how we,
we actually kind of like build this

81
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:46,619
community, uh, uh, uh, not cheating, but
community aware maybe, uh, in the team.

82
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,059
Emily Hunkler: Yeah, absolutely.

83
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,189
And I think that's, it's so great to hear.

84
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:50,489
So.

85
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:57,279
Uh, kind of empowering your team members
to get involved, to help edge further

86
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,309
education, that sort of thing about,
about WordPress in general, about

87
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:04,839
what's out there and keeping everyone
aware and involved and supported

88
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,989
and feedback, like you mentioned,
is such a big part of that as well.

89
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,859
And knowing how to receive
feedback, how to implement feedback,

90
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,599
um, how do you give feedback?

91
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,959
All of those sorts of things
all go into kind of building a

92
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,579
productive community, for sure.

93
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,599
So that's awesome.

94
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:23,799
Um, What are some ways you've touched on
this a little bit already, but what are

95
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:28,299
some other, um, some of those ways that,
that Weglot contributes to the WordPress

96
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:29,960
community and the remote community.

97
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,179
Are you guys a remote team?

98
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:35,229
Thomas Fenchin: I mean, part of the
team is working remotely like myself.

99
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,429
I just moved to one.

100
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,239
So we are based in Paris and, but I
mean, we, we, we, we do support, like

101
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:48,369
I said, events, meetups, WordCamps,
and I feel like just last week we

102
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:52,884
announced, that we are now WordPress
Global community sponsor, which

103
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:56,454
means that we are now supporting all
the, uh, WordCamps to meetups all

104
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:57,835
around the world, which is awesome.

105
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:02,634
And, uh, this is, uh, uh, one
of the ways that we are actually

106
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:03,835
supporting the community.

107
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:08,844
There's also the, we do support a
lot of resources, podcasts, blogs

108
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:12,414
to help, uh, the community and
funds from the community grow.

109
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:19,454
And, uh, another way is also, uh, to
create, uh, sort of educational content

110
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:24,044
webinars guides about multilingual,
and about our area of expertise.

111
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:24,254
Really.

112
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,034
Emily Hunkler: I love that.

113
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:26,905
That's fantastic.

114
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:30,355
I, I saw that you all were
global sponsors, with WordPress

115
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:31,675
as well, so that's fantastic.

116
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,355
Um, that's, that's all so great and it is
so important to when you have that remote

117
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:40,855
team and recognize the importance of, of,
of supporting those people, even though

118
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,855
you're not there and you, you, yourself
being one of those remote team members.

119
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:44,125
Right.

120
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,165
So, so, you know, firsthand for sure.

121
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:47,905
Um, wonderful.

122
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:50,365
How, what are some ways
on that note, especially.

123
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:56,034
Um, Weglot helps to support their, their
teams, um, physical and mental wellbeing.

124
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,325
Thomas Fenchin: I mean, uh,
first, uh, like I said, there's

125
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:01,645
like a lot of team activities.

126
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:07,914
So, for example, we do like online,
uh, chocoholic testing, online

127
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,314
cheese testing, and we do a lot of
fun activities like escape game.

128
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:15,085
In one time we did an escape game
online it was like, uh, awesome.

129
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:18,655
And there's also like in-person
meeting where, uh, for example,

130
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:23,674
every two weeks we meet at a bar
and, uh, we have like a time off.

131
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:28,489
Uh, there's also like what we call,
uh, sometimes we go and we're going to

132
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,480
go skiing together for, for example,
in the next, like the next few weeks.

133
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,770
Uh, the last time we went and we
went on a, on a, on a mountain

134
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,940
bike, a trail, it was awesome too.

135
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:45,710
So, I mean, there's like, like
I said, online activities, uh,

136
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,690
physical in-person activities, uh,
for remote workers like myself.

137
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:55,819
Uh, we, we, we do have,
uh, an mean for everyone.

138
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:59,420
We really, from the team, because everyone
is now working remotely, you have like all

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,930
your equipments for your home office, but
it's like a sponsored basically by Weglot,

140
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,319
so, which mean that you have your screens,
your chair, your camera and everything,

141
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:14,540
like for your home office, uh, set up, uh,
kind of sponsored by Weglot, which means

142
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,400
that, uh, you, you, you can like work at
a, at the, at a nice place at home too.

143
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,744
Emily Hunkler: That's amazing.

144
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:22,224
That's great.

145
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,234
We're going to have to share if
you guys are hiring at the end of

146
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,885
this community, this interview.

147
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:26,845
Cause I think you just sold.

148
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,635
Everybody's going to
want to work at Weglot.

149
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,355
Um, that's amazing though.

150
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:33,625
That's fantastic because it also
sounds like you all recognize.

151
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:38,859
That wellbeing, mental health and
physical health look different

152
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:39,880
for different people, right?

153
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,210
Whether that is getting together
personally, and whether it's, uh, you

154
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,599
know, going mountain biking or skiing
or meeting at a bar, or whether it's

155
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,210
something that people, other types of
people are more comfortable with, like

156
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,869
an online meetup and getting together
that way and making sure you're set

157
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,540
up to be comfortable in your office
at home and that sort of thing.

158
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,500
So that's, that's amazing.

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,050
That sounds like you guys are
doing really cool stuff for your

160
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,040
team, and it's awesome to hear.

161
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,740
Um, way to go on that.

162
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:03,060
Uh, let's see.

163
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,420
Is there any to kind of wrap up this
interview is, do you, is there any kind

164
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,079
of personal anecdote that you could
