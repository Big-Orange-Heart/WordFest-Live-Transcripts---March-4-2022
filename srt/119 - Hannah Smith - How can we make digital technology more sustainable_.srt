Um, I'm excited to introduce
our next speaker, Hannah Smith,

39
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,204
presenting how can we make digital
technology more sustainable.

40
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:17,364
Hannah is a freelance WordPress

50
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:51,505
Hannah Smith: Fantastic.

51
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,614
Hello, Kim and Lindsey.

52
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:53,934
Hello, everyone watching.

53
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:56,845
Lindsey Miller: Welcome Hannah.

54
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:58,435
Hannah Smith: Thank you.

55
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:00,685
All right.

56
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:01,315
Okay.

57
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:02,394
I have the screens.

58
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,435
I have a few screens in front of me here.

59
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,714
I can see what's going on in my left eye.

60
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:09,894
My slides are in front of
me, so let's get going.

61
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,894
I'm just going to check my
clicker works and then let's

62
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:15,114
get talking about today's topic.

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:16,980
Okay.

64
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,370
Great.

65
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,600
Well, thank you to WordFest, um,
for accepting this talk and thank

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,530
you so much to all of you that
are here, um, in difficult times.

67
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,290
Um, it's really nice to know that
you have the head space to come

68
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,469
along and learn about how we can make
digital technology more sustainable.

69
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,830
Let me introduce myself.

70
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,830
I'm already had a very nice
introduction so I guess I don't

71
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,270
need to say an awful lot more.

72
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,039
Um, I live in bris.

73
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,630
Uh, I live in the Southwest.

74
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm a freelancer who works with
WordPress and I liked dogs.

75
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,969
So if you're not into digital
tech, you can always talk

76
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,140
to me about dogs or plants.

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,310
That's absolutely fine.

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,060
I run a meetup group in the
Southwest called Greentech Southwest.

79
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,690
Um, I also used to run the
Bristol WordPress meetup.

80
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:02,539
Um, and as mentioned, I'm a fellow
with the green web foundation too.

81
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,539
And co-organizer of, uh, uh, sorry,
co-founder of an, uh, an online campaign

82
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,140
we did on Twitter called let's green
the web run with climateaction.Tech.

83
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,539
So today's talk.

84
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,515
I'm just going to reset my timer.

85
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:18,905
There we go.

86
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,195
So today's talk.

87
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,305
What am I going to cover?

88
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,265
Well, the first thing I'm going to talk
about with you all is I'm going to give

89
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,575
you an overview of what sustainability is.

90
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:31,055
We've all got probably different
ideas of what that word means.

91
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,675
So I'm going to talk about that.

92
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:36,875
I'm going to talk a little bit about
areas we can focus our efforts on,

93
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:41,675
particularly for those of us working in
the system with digital technologies.

94
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,125
And all throughout the talk.

95
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:49,015
My plan is to litter um, talk
with approaches and ideas that you

96
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,785
might find useful to investigate.

97
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,535
I think when you talk about
what something is, it's useful

98
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:55,795
to talk about what it isn't.

99
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,585
So let's just get that bit
out of the way straight away.

100
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:03,385
So what this talk isn't I'm not hating on
digital tape, WordPress or the internet.

101
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:07,705
They bring some significant
possibilities and solutions, um, but

102
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,385
they do have an environmental impact.

103
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:10,765
So we're going to talk about that.

104
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,210
Um, this is not a masterclass
on the whole topic.

105
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,679
We've got half an hour.

106
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,739
Um, I think you could literally, um, you
know, run a whole week's worth of content

107
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,630
on, on what we're talking about today.

108
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:30,840
So the idea with my talk is to give
you a food for thought introduction

109
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,400
to kind of get some conversation
started and maybe to get your brain

110
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,669
whirring in a different direction that
perhaps it hasn't worked in before.

111
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,865
And ultimately my goal today is to empower
you with some knowledge that you might

112
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:50,745
take away, uh, you might choose to, to
use, um, or talk to other people about.

113
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:55,275
Okay, so that's the intro
let's get to talking about how

114
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,315
do we define sustainability.

115
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:02,505
Um, so this is how I tend
to think of sustainability.

116
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:08,325
It's meeting the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of

117
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,935
future generations to meet their needs.

118
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:17,635
So it's about not taking more today than
those in the future, uh, can sustain it.

119
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,725
It's about taking our fair shares.

120
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:24,585
Um, and there's three pillars,
uh, with sustainability.

121
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:25,935
Um,

122
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,349
So I tend to think about these three sort
of facets, which all interconnect and

123
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,849
you definitely can't sort of draw these
very clear, fine lines between them all.

124
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,440
Um, but you can broadly think about
sustainability in three buckets.

125
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,130
If you like.

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,195
The environmental considerations, economic
considerations and social considerations.

127
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,075
So that's three areas to think of.

128
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:58,065
And I think the first thing that I
really wants to get across to you in

129
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:02,385
this talk is if you're here wanting
to learn about sustainability,

130
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:08,055
Yeah, as I say, the first thing to
take away is that sustainability is

131
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:11,414
way more than just carbon emissions.

132
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:16,155
So a lot of people come to one thing
to make things more sustainable or

133
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,745
wanting to tackle climate change.

134
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:22,065
And they're very focused on carbon
emissions and that is a fantastic

135
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:25,995
starting point, but I think it's really
important for us to all understand

136
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:34,010
that real sustainability is going to
be work across those three sectors.

137
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,450
So carbon emissions falls into
environmental, but we've got economic

138
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,120
and social to think about as well.

139
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,160
So that's my first tip for you
from today's talk is sustainability

140
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
is a lot more than just thinking
about carbon emission reductions.

141
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,710
Okay.

142
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,670
What I'm going to do for the rest of
this talk is get into each of those

143
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,930
three pillars and talk about how
those relate to digital technologies.

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,380
So let's start off with
environmental pillar.

145
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,520
Um, now I tend to think of this
pillar as natural resources.

146
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,410
And, uh, many, many of you
may be aware of this already.

147
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,250
Many of you may not know this already,
but digital tech does actually

148
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,170
use a lot of natural resources.

149
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:26,250
First of all, we actually have to power
our digital tech and a lot of that

150
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,320
power still comes from fossil fuels.

151
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
And we'll talk about that a
little bit more in a second.

152
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,360
We also have a lot of rare raw
materials in our digital tech,

153
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,160
for example, cobalt and lithium.

154
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,790
Um, both of which do
used in mobile phones.

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,430
Lithium is a very important
component in battery.

156
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,365
Digital tech is also using
an increasing amount of land.

157
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:53,324
Now you might be wondering what,
where where's that land coming from?

158
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:58,785
Well, data centers are taking up
an increasing amount of land land

159
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:03,015
that could be used for other things,
of course, and water as well.

160
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:08,415
A significant amount of water is used in
the production of our digital technology

161
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:13,545
and also use for example, for cooling,
um, power, um, uh, data centers.

162
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,600
This is not an exhaustive list of all
the ways that digital technologies

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,530
use natural resources, but I wanted
just to put across to you that digital

164
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,960
tech uses more than just energy.

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,890
There are some other things that
digital tech also consumes as well.

166
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,805
Now, one of the things that we
need to bear in mind is that

167
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:38,115
the misuse of resources leads to
interconnected ecological problems.

168
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:43,305
You can see on this diagram that
there are nine points in this circle.

169
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:49,455
Now these nine points come from, um,
a bunch of academics at the Stockholm

170
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:53,775
resilience center and they are the
ecological boundaries defined by them.

171
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:57,375
And these slides will be made
available to you after the talk.

172
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,240
There's links all throughout these slides.

173
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,590
Um, and you can see at the bottom
of this slide, there is a link to

174
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,270
the Stockholm resilience center.

175
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,350
Um, The Stockholm resilience center have
defined these nine ecological services

176
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,200
or nine ecological boundaries within
which our environments, uh, works.

177
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,910
So can you see in the top right there that
we've got kind of, I'm pointing, obviously

178
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,470
you, you can't see what I'm pointing at.

179
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,520
Uh, still not got the hang of
online talks, um, after two years.

180
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,140
Um, so in the, in the sort of what,
just, I don't know, like five past 12

181
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,970
position, you can see climate change.

182
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:40,694
So climate change is typically where
the consideration of climate emission

183
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:46,375
falls in, but we have these eight other
points as well, which are all types

184
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,950
of ecological problems and they're
all ecological problems that the

185
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,020
earth is suffering with at the moment.

186
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,550
So again, just coming back to that
point, that sustainability is a lot more

187
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,990
than just thinking about the climate
change ecological problem that's hot

188
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,490
on everybody's lips at the moment.

189
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,680
There are other things to consider.

190
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,050
And it's an ecosystem.

191
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,490
It's complicated.

192
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,500
So an issue in one area will have
knock-on effects in others as well.

193
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,330
So this is why we need to take a
holistic picture and a holistic view

194
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,790
of the intergalactic interconnected,
ecological problems that exist.

195
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,094
Um, so this is, I think this
is a really cool diagram.

196
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,525
I'm really into diagrams.

197
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:33,194
So maybe this will resonate with some
of you watching, maybe not all of you.

198
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,525
Um, but this is taken again
from the Stockholm resilience.

199
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,930
And what they've done here is they have
rated the severity of these ecological

200
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,490
systems and the sort of taller and
more orange, the, um, the, the segment

201
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,650
that the more we're we're in trouble.

202
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,760
So novel entities, this is academic speak.

203
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,520
It basically means kind of like plastics
and chemicals that are in our ecosystem

204
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,780
that shouldn't really be there.

205
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,650
So you can see, again, that one
sort of it's five past 12, or sort

206
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,330
of between 12 and two that says
novel entities is, is very extreme.

207
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,740
We're in massive trouble there.

208
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,950
Interestingly enough, climate
change, which is just over

209
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,350
to the left, um, is orange.

210
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:18,740
So we.

211
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,375
Operating outside of the safe space.

212
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:24,495
And you're also noticed there,
maybe you can see the writing,

213
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,755
it says increasing risk.

214
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:29,865
And for any of you that are following
climate change news, you might

215
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:34,335
be aware of the recent IPC report
that came out this week that, um,

216
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:38,415
painted a rather scary picture as
far as climate change is concerned.

217
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:43,035
Um, so I wonder whether the Stockholm
resilience center might revise where that

218
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,705
climate change market is in light of.

219
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,700
Anyway, I just wanted to paint
a sort of picture for you of a

220
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,800
wider context of what's going on.

221
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,730
And I really strongly recommend if
you're into this kind of stuff, go

222
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,700
and have a look at the work that
they're doing there, it's fantastic.

223
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,800
But anyway, I want to sort of come
back to the world of digital tech

224
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,490
and anchor some points for you
that that will be relevant to you.

225
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,120
Um, so let's talk about
energy and greenhouse gas

226
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,270
emissions, which includes CO2.

227
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,925
And as I mentioned already,
this is a great starting point.

228
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:22,905
So if you're new to considering tech
sustainability and new to considering your

229
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:27,495
place within tech sustainability, this
is a great place to begin your journey,

230
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,415
and we've all got to start somewhere.

231
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:33,735
So what I don't want this talk to
do is to sort of almost paralyze

232
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,925
you with the enormity of everything.

233
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,755
Just be aware of the wider context
and hone in and start your journey.

234
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:46,755
And just consider it as entering one
part of one of those nine boundaries.

235
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,705
So w we're talking climate change.

236
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,885
Oh, and it's the point here that
it's worth me just mentioning.

237
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,005
I did talk about greenhouse gas emissions.

238
00:14:56,265 --> 00:15:00,105
So the sub point here is that
greenhouse gas emissions do include

239
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:05,505
carbon dioxide, but there are some
other, um, types of gases as well that

240
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,185
are contributing to climate change.

241
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:11,295
You've probably heard about methane, but
there's also nitrous oxide and a couple

242
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,855
of others, which are very long words.

243
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,815
And I'm not going to try and
say right now, but you can read

244
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,135
those at the bottom of the slide.

245
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:21,285
So let's talk about digital services.

246
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,550
I mentioned already that digital
tech uses natural resources

247
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,430
and does use a lot of energy.

248
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,940
And that energy creates
greenhouse gas emissions.

249
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,580
And it's estimated that ICT, which is
another way of saying digital services.

250
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,300
ICT stands for information
communication technologies.

251
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,350
If you haven't heard that term before,
it's estimated that it creates between

252
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,850
1.2 and 3.9% of greenhouse gas emissions.

253
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:57,645
So you might be sitting there thinking
I've really no idea if that's a lot

254
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,865
or if that's not, not a, not a lot.

255
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:04,125
So here's some ways to think about
it, and maybe some ways you may

256
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,775
have already seen this talked about.

257
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,915
So we can think about the greenhouse
gas emissions arising from

258
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,355
tech, as bigger than aviation.

259
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,230
Now, this is often talked about, and it
is a sort of attention grabbing fact,

260
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,420
but I would say, please do consider
how many people have access to flying.

261
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,500
It's about 20% of the global population
versus have access to the internet

262
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,140
and digital services, which is about
60% and also the benefits of each.

263
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,400
So I might argue that digital tech
actually holds a lot more benefits for

264
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,380
people than perhaps taking a flight.

265
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:45,270
So just to put that into context,
but it is still bigger than aviation.

266
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,699
And if ICT or the digital services
was a country, it would be the

267
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,829
seventh biggest polluter in the world.

268
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:56,055
So again, just putting
that into context for you.

269
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,040
Um, I mentioned already.

270
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,060
I love diagrams.

271
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,190
Um, so I've popped this in very briefly.

272
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,480
We're not going to spend long on it.

273
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,589
Um, this comes from a fantastic
website called the, our world in

274
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,680
data and it's just there to show you.

275
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,075
Good.

276
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,315
What sectors are creating
greenhouse gas emissions.

277
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:20,385
Now you won't see digital tech or ICT or
the internet on this diagram, but you will

278
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:23,514
see aviation and aviation is bottom right.

279
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,395
So it's about what like five o'clock.

280
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,945
And you'll see that that says 1.9%,
but you can see the vast majority of

281
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:34,965
greenhouse gas emissions are being
caused by the creation and use of energy.

282
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,695
Agriculture and forestry
and land use is about 18%.

283
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,905
So anyway, just again, to
put things into context.

284
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,430
Now the other thing that we should
be aware of with digital tech is that

285
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,010
demand and usage for ICT is on the up.

286
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,280
At the moment we've only got
60% of the world who really

287
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,140
have access to digital services.

288
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,940
So there's that other 40% of the world
hopefully are able to join the rest of us.

289
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,810
We're going to see demand and usage go
up and we're going to see it go up for

290
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,240
all sorts of other reasons as we invent
new things, um, and as we're using

291
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
digital services more in our lives,

292
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:16,335
So again, I just want to put that
growth into some context for you.

293
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:21,645
Let's just say for argument's sake,
the internet was built in about 1987,

294
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,295
like it's roughly around that time.

295
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:28,575
Um, you can see that roughly then the,
the amount of global IP traffic was two

296
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:33,105
terabytes hop on 40 years later to 2017.

297
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,965
And it's 1.1 zettabyte.

298
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,310
If you're wondering how bit a zettabyte
is that a boat is it's that big.

299
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,680
It's got that many zeros at the end of it.

300
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,620
Um, so it's 21 zeros at the end of it.

301
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,580
So it's rather large.

302
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
We're a terabytes only got 12.

303
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,900
And the really mad thing is that when
this report was written, um, it was

304
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,680
predicted to grow again in a five-year
period to 4.8 zettabytes per year of,

305
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,810
of data flying around the internet.

306
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,250
Going to take a quick drink.

307
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,070
So that's quite a lot.

308
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,900
Let's move on then.

309
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,780
Lots to talk to you about, hang on.

310
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,800
I'm going to have a little cough.

311
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,040
Sorry, not COVID, but I am
just getting over a nasty cold.

312
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:27,075
Okay.

313
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:32,865
So I'm going to very briefly talk to you
about how you might calculate the CO2

314
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:35,385
emissions of a website that you have.

315
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,125
Now I'm going to do this briefly.

316
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,785
And the idea of this part of the
talk is to give you a flavor and

317
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:44,205
to send you off, uh, to find some
resources that you, you can look up.

318
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,025
Oh, dear.

319
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,325
I was worried I might get a
bit of a tickle in my throat.

320
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:50,865
Okay.

321
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:53,115
Let's talk about the
key considerations then.

322
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:58,395
If you're trying to calculate
digital carbon emissions, there are

323
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,045
three things for you to consider.

324
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:04,875
First of all, what device are you using
or what device is your user using?

325
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:10,365
Where does your energy come from and
how much data is being sent to the user

326
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:13,465
or being transferred, EG per page load.

327
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:16,515
So let's talk a little bit about devices.

328
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:18,045
What devices are you using?

329
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:22,515
Well, as we've mentioned already,
digital tech uses quite a

330
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,795
lot of rare earth materials.

331
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,805
And I mentioned to you cobalt and lithium.

332
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:32,265
And one way to think about it
is that manufacturing any device

333
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,835
literally cost the earth it's
has to be made of something.

334
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,395
And the majority of total pollution
from digital devices actually comes from

335
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:47,040
manufacture, not use, which is still a
very surprising fact for me, but it's

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,899
been corroborated by a number of different
places and smartphones are the worst.

337
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:57,939
Um, and these rare raw materials,
which are hard to find and very

338
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:02,919
destructive to find and extract and
do affect the communities from which

339
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,540
these things are being extracted are
also very hard to recycle currently.

340
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,750
So this is a cool report.

341
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,530
Uh, the energy and carbon
footprint of the global ICT and

342
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,810
E and M sectors catchy title.

343
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,030
Um, it was written in 2018.

344
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:24,620
Um, and I just picked out a nice
graphic from there, which shows you.

345
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:30,735
Um, for some of the main devices that
are manufactured, the gray bar is telling

346
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:36,585
you basically how much CO2 is embodied
in the manufacturer of that device versus

347
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:42,690
how much CO2 is, is, is admitted, when
uh, the device used or how much energy

348
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,560
is, is used over the life of that device.

349
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,240
So you can see TVs.

350
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,629
Okay.

351
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:53,310
TVs do actually generate a lot of
pollution when they're created.

352
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,820
And if you accept that it's kept for
seven years, you can see that the

353
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,100
energy use is really, really high.

354
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,450
So big, big screens, basically
guzzle a lot of energy to run.

355
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,385
Let's hop over to the
right-hand side of that diagram.

356
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:09,854
Let's have a look at smartphones.

357
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:15,705
So a smartphone generally will take a
lot less to manufacture, I think we're

358
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:18,074
looking at what, 70 odd kilograms.

359
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:22,185
And if you keep it for three
years, the energy consumption is.

360
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,450
Um, is much lower.

361
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,240
So something that we can take away from
this is try and use your phone for perhaps

362
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,760
shopping or watching content or, or doing
things on rather than a very big screen,

363
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,300
because you can see that you'd be using
a significant, less amount of energy.

364
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,530
Something else that I hope we could take
away from looking at a diagram like this

365
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,975
is how important it is to extend the
life of any device that you are lucky

366
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,655
enough to come into the ownership of.

367
00:22:54,075 --> 00:23:00,105
The longer that you are able to keep that
device the less, um, the longer you can

368
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:05,055
make the, the carbon or the, the carbon
that went into manufacturing the device,

369
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:07,215
the longer you can make that work for.

370
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:12,615
So for example, what I'm talking about
is not switch, not replacing your phone

371
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,795
often, not replacing your laptop often.

372
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:20,550
So how can we reframe
how we value our devices?

373
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,090
Can we reframe to think about
these devices as precious

374
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:26,189
and not just disposable?

375
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,050
And I encourage you to do that.

376
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,520
Um, I encourage you to think about, do
you really need to upgrade to the latest

377
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,990
device or is it just effective marketing
making you think you need something

378
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,419
faster and bigger and, and flashy.

379
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:44,805
So, if you're thinking about digital
sustainability, something you can do is

380
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,505
just hold on to your devices for longer.

381
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:51,195
It's actually a really easy
thing, a really easy action to

382
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,635
do, and it will save you money.

383
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,045
So what's not to love hate?

384
00:23:54,915 --> 00:24:01,035
Um, if perhaps your phone does break or
it does need, uh, to be a bit beefier,

385
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,375
maybe you could repair or upgrade it.

386
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:08,240
Now I know that that's a little tricky
with phones, but that's becoming more

387
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,240
easy across a whole suite of electronics.

388
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,510
Um, and I encourage you to have a
look at the right to repair movement.

389
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,139
Could you get a refurbed
or secondhand device?

390
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,120
And it is now possible, increasingly
possible to buy ethically made devices.

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,780
Now, these ethically made devices
do typically cost a lot more, but

392
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,260
the idea is that you hold onto
them for a lot time, longer time.

393
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:34,129
So Fairphone, I wonder how many of
you here have heard of Fairphone?

394
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,710
Um, a mobile phone manufacturer.

395
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,835
So, this is a tweet from someone I hold
in very high esteem, a lady called Kate

396
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:46,065
Raworth, um, who is the originator of
doughnut economics, which we're going to

397
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:48,585
touch on briefly in, in a few slides time.

398
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,365
Um, and once this tweet, this
tweet is getting on a bit

399
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,895
now actually is from 2020.

400
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:57,585
Um, but she was talking about
how fair phones are made, the

401
00:24:57,585 --> 00:24:59,295
way that phones should be made.

402
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,165
Um, they're made to be repairable
upgradable, and there the

403
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:07,585
resources that are put into
them come from ethical sources.

404
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,665
So yeah, we do end up playing, paying a
little bit more for these things, but that

405
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:14,065
reflects perhaps the true cost to society.

406
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,090
I'm just going to talk very
briefly about e-waste as well.

407
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,870
So I mentioned in a previous slide
that it can be quite tough to recycle,

408
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,690
um, uh, that the resources that go in.

409
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,530
Um, and so what happens is that we just
I'm sure many of you will find that

410
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,250
the same, you don't know what to do
with your electronic waste cables or

411
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,560
laptops or phones, and we throw it away.

412
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,030
And 50 million tons of e-waste
is being produced each year.

413
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,254
And from 2016, that UN estimated that only
20% of that waste is actually recycled.

414
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:53,534
Um, and the EU parliament estimates
that obsolete cables generate over

415
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:56,504
51,000 tons of e-waste per year.

416
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:59,085
And I don't know about you,
but I've got a drawer of cables

417
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,284
I don't know what to do with.

418
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:05,085
And the key question to consider
is where does our e-waste end up

419
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:09,795
and who is ultimately paying for
the disposal of that e-waste?

420
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:14,955
Now this is a photo from an e-waste
recycling facility in Ghana.

421
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,275
It's called ACBL blushy.

422
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:17,925
It's now been closed down.

423
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:22,005
And if you're interested in climate
justice this is a fascinating case study

424
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:28,200
because on the one hand You could argue
that recycling facilities such as this

425
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,870
whilst perhaps not the most technology
technologically advanced do have some

426
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,170
social good because they're giving
people jobs, they're creating a circular

427
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,530
economy, but on the one hand, on the
other hand is unregulated and unsafe.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,340
Um, so there's all sorts
of interesting issues here.

429
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,659
And I've put a few links in the
bottom of these, this slide.

430
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,350
Um,  is a fantastic reporter based in
Africa who has written some incredibly

431
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:02,040
insightful reporting about ag Bob blushy
and, um, raising the voices of the people

432
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,399
that, that live and exist on that site.

433
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,879
Um, as I say, it's complicated situation.

434
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,669
Worth looking into anyway,

435
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm going to move on because I've got
tons of slides and time is ticking.

436
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,680
So let's talk briefly about that second
point where your energy comes from.

437
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,690
So worldwide 63% of the
world's electricity came

438
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,820
from fossil fuels in 2019.

439
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,780
So as a global society, we are still
burning fossil fuels far too readily.

440
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,460
But we should also be aware that
renewable energy is not a panacea,

441
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,380
so creating renewable energy still
requires natural resources and there's

442
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,460
still an issue of what to do with
the solar panels and wind turbines

443
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,230
when they reach their end of life.

444
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,420
But it is less than fossil fuels.

445
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,850
So it's the right
direction to transition to.

446
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,740
However we should be looking to
reduce the overall overall amount

447
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,730
of energy needed by addressing
consumption and efficiency issues.

448
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,210
And then once we've reduced the amount
of energy possible, we want to look

449
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,650
for the energy with the lowest impact,
which at this time is renewable energy.

450
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,780
This is a cool fact.

451
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:23,450
Apparently 80% is the amounts if
everyone in the ICT sector used

452
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,130
renewable energy, we could reduce the
car, the sector's footprint by 80%.

453
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,780
So that is a massive,
massive, uh, motivator to, um,

454
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:35,865
Switch to renewable energy.

455
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:37,935
So here we go.

456
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:41,985
Here's something that all of us
listening to this talk, all of our

457
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:46,575
colleagues can do is look for hosting
that runs on renewable energy.

458
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,615
It makes a big difference.

459
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:52,975
And the green web foundation, which I
do a lot of work with is a fantastic

460
00:28:52,975 --> 00:28:57,025
resource for understanding what energy
sources, hosts, and servers are using.

461
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:02,035
And we've got plans to really expand
that data set and provide a lot more

462
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:05,784
information and cover a lot more than
hosts and servers so watch this space.

463
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,590
Another thing, if you're sort of a
bit more technical, perhaps you are

464
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,780
choosing a data center to work with,
um, also consider the PUE, which

465
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,820
is the power usage effectiveness.

466
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,530
And that basically determines how much and
how energy efficient the data center is.

467
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,950
So if it's 1.2, it's
considered very efficient.

468
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,919
So just a little bit for
you to think about there.

469
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,550
I'm going to move on to talk about
how much data are you sending.

470
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,450
So there's a third one.

471
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:37,754
So data transfer equals
energy consumption.

472
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:43,365
So we, if, well, I say we as developers,
I'm sure that many of you listening,

473
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,235
won't be developers you'll have other
roles as well, but for those of us

474
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:51,195
who are developers, something that
we can do is reduce the amount of

475
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:57,334
stuff, loading every single time a
page, um, is, um, is, is requested.

476
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:02,250
So this is yet another reason to
care ever so greatly about web

477
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,840
performance and optimization.

478
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,250
We know we should care about this stuff,
but sometimes it's easy not to, especially

479
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,580
if you're lucky enough to live in a
Western country with a fast broadband

480
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,940
connection, but not only should we
care about making services accessible.

481
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,700
We also have a climate change reason.

482
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,180
The more efficient our tech
is the less energy it uses.

483
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,190
And the better that is for the planet.

484
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,970
And the sustainable web design
has a great write-up about this.

485
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,850
And I've added some really
useful measurement tools at the

486
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,040
end of this slide pack as well.

487
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,360
So I'm going to rattle through a few tips
for you, how you can reduce data transfer,

488
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,730
sorts of things that you can think about.

489
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,205
So if you are a developer, How
about creating and storing the

490
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:52,125
data that you actually need.

491
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:55,665
So perhaps reduce backups
and archives and logs.

492
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:58,815
Not saying don't have them, but
maybe go back and think, do I really

493
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,405
need these logs from 12 years ago?

494
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:02,985
Reduce analytics, data.

495
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:05,264
Google analytics is very, very heavy.

496
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:09,945
And I would argue that Google analytics,
depending on the size of your site,

497
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:13,995
but Google analytics probably shouldn't
be your default choice for analytics

498
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,245
because of the amount of cruft it loads.

499
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,270
And also remove plugins and
any third party services that

500
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,590
we no longer written need.

501
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,160
Transfer media content on demand.

502
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,000
So ditch auto play videos,
they consume a lot of energy

503
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,290
because they run immediately.

504
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,110
And while there's lots of evidence
to say users don't like them

505
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,600
and lazy load images and video.

506
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:41,085
Other things you can do, especially
if you're a content editor is pay

507
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:45,105
attention to images, use the right
image format for the right type.

508
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:50,385
Compress and optimized JPEGs, and
display images of the right dimensions.

509
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:57,135
So don't have a 2000 pixel image in a 1000
pixel space, just load in the 1000 pixel

510
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,935
image when you're creating the content.

511
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:03,600
And do have a look at things like image
source set or the picture tags, which are

512
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,600
HTML tags, which really help you to serve
images responsibly and WordPress has some

513
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,380
helper functions as well that can help you
with installing, uh, with making use of.

514
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,409
Update the latest, the latest version
of PHP and WordPress, and as mentioned

515
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:24,000
disabled and needed code plugins and
dequeue scripts you don't need that.

516
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,899
It's basically a whistle-stop tour of
what Tom Greenwood has talked about

517
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,610
in his book, sustainable web design.

518
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,280
Now.

519
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:36,030
If you recall at the beginning of the
talk, I said that there were three

520
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,830
pillars to deal with sustainability.

521
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,850
We focused nearly all of our time
on today's talk, talking about the

522
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,740
environmental pillars, but I do want
to just briefly touch on the social and

523
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,960
economic ones as well, because the thing
is that making things more efficient,

524
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,600
doesn't always decrease consumption.

525
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,590
So actually there's a lot of research
that says that it can actually

526
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,909
increase usage because we make it
easier for people to use things.

527
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,429
So making our websites more efficient is
a very worthwhile thing to do, but it's

528
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:13,590
not the only thing we need to be doing.

529
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,229
We need to be asking
some bigger questions.

530
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:19,560
And if you're interested in this
concept that I've just talked about,

531
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,449
have a look at Jevons paradox.

532
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,880
So this leads us into why we
need to think about economics.

533
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,440
And a brief definition of economics
is it's a social science that studies

534
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,340
the site it's oh, I put science
twice in there, a social science that

535
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,970
studies the science of production,
distribution and consumption of wealth.

536
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,330
And it's basically the bit that
dues the other two pillars together.

537
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,310
And it is also a way of articulating
the systems, the decision-making

538
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,080
systems that we exist with.

539
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,290
Now I mentioned one of my absolute
heroes, Kate Raworth earlier, if you're

540
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,010
interested in this kind of thing, do you
have a look at donut economics, her book,

541
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,389
and there's also a fantastic website
called the doughnut economics action lab,

542
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:05,100
which I spend a lot of time on as well.

543
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,810
It's full of really interesting resources
about the wider questions we should be

544
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,989
asking about the systems that we exist.

545
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:18,225
Um, and also if you're really interested
in this, I'd highly recommend a book

546
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:22,995
called less is more by Jason Hickle,
which is actually suggesting that I

547
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:28,335
would desire to grow, grow, grow, needs
to be an inhabited if we're really going

548
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:29,625
to seriously tackle climate change.

549
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,340
And I bring that up here because I
do think that within the tech sector,

550
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,710
we are still a little bit beholden
to this idea of growing all the time.

551
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,239
More, features, more sites,
more clients, more, more, more.

552
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,630
And I think that this is a very
interesting concept to think of.

553
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:53,094
Okay, I've got a few more
slides and then we'll be done.

554
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:56,185
Um, so apologies to the, um, facilitators.

555
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:58,105
I might run over by a minute or two.

556
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:00,714
Um, social change.

557
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:05,544
Oh, so this pillar I wanted just to
make relevant to us as tech makers.

558
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:10,245
So those of us who are creating
digital services or are somehow

559
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,045
involved in the creation.

560
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:18,045
Now we need to change the way that we
are working if we want to make tech

561
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:23,115
more sustainable, if we want there
to be the same opportunities for

562
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:25,305
future generations that we have today.

563
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:27,555
We need to ask some
questions of ourselves.

564
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,375
We need to ask what do we create tech?

565
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,765
So I think of tech websites,
digital services are simply

566
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,015
an accelerator of solutions.

567
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:44,265
Intrinsically my personal belief is
that I don't think tech is good or bad.

568
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:49,275
It is a bit bad when it's used wastefully
is, as I talked about in my previous

569
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:54,105
slides, but on balance, essentially,
it just accelerates solutions.

570
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:59,065
So we have to ask ourselves, well, which
solutions are we choosing to accelerate?

571
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,205
Who are we choosing to lift up?

572
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:08,265
And most importantly, who is benefiting
from what we're accelerating?

573
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,024
Who benefits from these solutions?

574
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:15,105
Who's standing to lose out
from what we're creating?

575
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,145
Whose needs are we ignoring?

576
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:19,544
Who has the decision-making power?

577
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,185
And I think within the WordPress
community, that's a really

578
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,714
interesting question at the moment.

579
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:25,165
Um, more.

580
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:29,560
I was getting Morton's full name,
wrong Morten Rand-Hendriksen.

581
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:33,359
I'm sure y'all know who, I mean has
just done a really interesting podcast

582
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,250
with WP Tavern talking about this.

583
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,549
So I think this is an issue
within our own community that

584
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:39,930
we could be addressing as well.

585
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,319
And who feels the
burdens of our decisions.

586
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:49,485
So, what I want to say to you is that
if you're interested in sustainability,

587
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:53,955
you are going to, by default, end up
going down a road of realizing that

588
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:56,205
climate justice equals social justice.

589
00:36:56,535 --> 00:37:00,915
And you're going to realize that
social issues are completely wrapped

590
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:03,315
up in making things more sustainable.

591
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,755
So it's a core concept of climate
justice to think about social justice.

592
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,075
And as I mentioned before, it may
be difficult doing these things

593
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:16,035
because we exist within systems
that don't make it easy for us.

594
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:20,955
So we have to think beyond current
paradigms that we're in and you

595
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,235
might hear the phrase system
change, not climate change.

596
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,255
And that's what that means.

597
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,855
It means that the systems that are
making the decisions around us are

598
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:29,505
not fit for purpose at the moment.

599
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:34,785
They don't allow us to tackle
social injustice in the world.

600
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,165
Okay, I'm going to skip this slide.

601
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,295
That's a terribly scary diagram.

602
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:44,924
So as technologists, we need to
challenge how we think and behave as

603
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:48,615
individuals as well as challenging
the systems we exist within.

604
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:52,965
So summing up, this is a diagram
I've been working on recently.

605
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:57,795
Two highlights what it means to
build a sustainable internet.

606
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:02,325
Um, a lot of people may have come to
this talk, expecting my talk to talk

607
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:07,035
loads about efficient tech and renewable
energy and maybe even buying offsets.

608
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,865
So the stuff on the left-hand
side of the diagram.

609
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:14,865
But actually, if we're interested in
sustainable internet or in sustainable

610
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:21,165
digital services, there's a whole
myriad of interrelated, social and

611
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:25,875
economic factors that we need to
think about as well as efficient

612
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,215
tech and using renewable energy.

613
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:33,055
And again, I just want to stress to
you if you're new to this journey.

614
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,755
Because it is a journey
and it's a journey.

615
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:35,925
We're all going to have to go on.

616
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:40,335
If you're new to this and your starting
steps are to make the tech that you're

617
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,465
using more efficient, then good for you.

618
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,015
That's a fantastic thing to be doing.

619
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:50,505
Once you've done that and you're ready
to move on there's a myriad of other

620
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:55,215
things that you can put your time and
energy into that will make a difference.

621
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:57,615
And of course, there's
lots of co-benefits.

622
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,520
So improving the sustainability of
digital services creates all sorts

623
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,799
of lovely side benefits to humans and
the planet we can reduce resource use,

624
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,049
improve accessibility in UX, improve
performance and speed, and ultimately

625
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,340
make us more fulfilled and happier
humans, which is good for everyone.

626
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,800
It's good for the social good.

627
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,885
So there's lots and lots
of reasons to do this.

628
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:27,525
Um, and I look forward to hearing
any questions, any reactions to what

629
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:32,415
I've talked about today and hopefully
meeting some of you in the communities

630
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:36,575
that are seeking to make these kinds
of changes for everybody's good.

631
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,775
So, thank you very much.

632
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:40,035
That's the end of my talk.

633
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:42,825
Thank you for bearing with me
and apologies to the organizers

634
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:44,145
for running a few minutes over.

635
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:48,225
Um, my slides will have been
published on Twitter by now.

636
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:52,035
So my handle is hanopcan, so
you can find the slides there

637
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,375
and there's loads more to go.

638
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:57,795
There's all these sort of resources that
I've put at the end for you as well.

639
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:01,185
So you can have a look through
those and kind of go on a really

640
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:03,225
fantastic journey of discovery.

641
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:04,884
Thank you very much.

642
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,115
Kim Coleman: Thank you so much, Hannah.

643
00:40:08,174 --> 00:40:09,285
Lindsey Miller: Great Hannah.

644
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:09,825
Yep.

645
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:11,654
We're both excited way to go.

646
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:12,645
That was really awesome.

647
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:13,395
Hannah Smith: Good.

648
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:13,694
Good.

649
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:14,024
Okay.

650
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:18,855
I'm just going to stop sharing my
screen a second and I can come back

651
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:23,745
to you and like look at you square on
because otherwise you're on my profile.

652
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,285
I'm a big Roman nose right.

653
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:27,705
There we go.

654
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,225
Hello Kim and Lindsey.

655
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,069
Kim Coleman: Awesome.

656
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm going to kick off the questioning
with just kind of a background.

657
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,470
How did you personally get invested
and involved in this topic and the

658
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,109
topics in general that you presented?

659
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:43,754
Hannah Smith: Yeah.

660
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:46,665
I mean, I've always been really
interested in environmental

661
00:40:46,665 --> 00:40:48,674
issues ever since a little kid.

662
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:51,975
Um, I worked for the environment
agency is, as you mentioned in my

663
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:56,504
intro, um, and then about two and
a half years ago, I went to word

664
00:40:56,504 --> 00:41:01,125
camp Europe in Berlin and heard Jack
Lennox give a talk at WordCamp Europe

665
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:04,515
about making websites more efficient.

666
00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:08,115
And I'd been thinking for quite
some time, I didn't think that

667
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:11,960
the WordPress community had been
doing enough around sustainability.

668
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,210
I wasn't hearing enough conversations.

669
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,990
Um, so love to hear Jack's talk,
Jack and I, and our good friends.

670
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,880
We've been working on a
few projects together.

671
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,350
But it was that, and the work of whole
grain digital that really made me realize,

672
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,730
Hey, they're all people in the WordPress
community who are talking about this.

673
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,640
Um, and you know, there's hope for us.

674
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,080
We can, we can do this.

675
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,860
Um, so yeah, so it was sort
of other community members

676
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,640
really that, that kind of.

677
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:41,295
Really pushed me on this direction.

678
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:45,735
And then I've sort of been finding
my own path, um, since then as well.

679
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:48,775
Lindsey Miller: Absolutely.

680
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:49,945
I see that you're not alone.

681
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:52,095
Oh, sorry.

682
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:54,525
We're not good at this.

683
00:41:55,725 --> 00:42:00,645
I know they have so many things to
say, like, Hannah, I was slacking

684
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:04,875
Kim, as you were talking, like, I just
felt like my jaw dropping through so

685
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:08,205
much of your talk and I can't wait
to download the slides on Twitter.

686
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:11,385
Um, cause it really was
absolutely fascinating.

687
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,975
And as you mentioned, there are other
people in the community that are

688
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:18,165
interested in leaning into this area.

689
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:21,435
Um, but I haven't seen it presented
in quite the way that you had.

690
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:23,145
So, um, thank you for that.

691
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:24,435
Hannah Smith: Um,

692
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:29,595
Lindsey Miller: no, it was really good.

693
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:33,944
Um, at least, I mean, even as I was paying
attention and wanting to like learn more,

694
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:42,225
so, um, Um, so I have a question from
from the chat she asks, does recycling

695
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:48,134
e-waste with our, does recycling the
waste also increase the CO2 and if so,

696
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:50,475
what is the best way to dispose of it?

697
00:42:51,254 --> 00:42:52,845
Hannah Smith: Oh, that's
such a good question.

698
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,395
And thank you for asking that.

699
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:58,544
Um, there's no easy answer.

700
00:42:58,634 --> 00:43:00,615
So, so recycling something.

701
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:06,765
Any kind of e-waste, as I mentioned,
e-waste will, um, contain these

702
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:11,325
rare raw materials that are hard
to find and extracting those from

703
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:15,705
the earth and producing them in the
first place is crazy, crazy, bad.

704
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:16,935
Like it's not good.

705
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:21,855
So any way that you can find to
recycle or reuse those things.

706
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,810
It's definitely going to be better for
carbon emissions, because if we were to

707
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,260
extract the same amount of resources,
again, that's going to be way more

708
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,930
policing than recycling and reusing.

709
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,580
The second part of the
question is to how we recycle.

710
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,680
Well, that's not easy.

711
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,910
There are some companies that now allow
you to send electronics back to them.

712
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,580
Um, certainly the bigger manufacturers.

713
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,190
Depending on where in the world you live,
maybe you have a local council that's good

714
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,170
enough to accept those resources for you.

715
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,330
But honestly, there's no easy answer
and it's kind of the tragedy of,

716
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:01,529
of a lot of this that we, we don't
know, and we're producing all this

717
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,359
stuff and it just goes into landfill.

718
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,785
So, um, it was so [audience name],
I think that asked the question.

719
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:11,535
I'm sorry that I can't give you like
an awesome answer because I don't think

720
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:17,115
there is one, um, just consume less
buy secondhand if you possibly can

721
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:21,975
and reuse what you can, you know, if
you've got that big drawer of cables

722
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:25,424
or that big drawer of stuff, see if
you can donate it to somebody else to

723
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:28,845
a local school or a community group
that that maybe could make use of it.

724
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:30,915
It's a great question.

725
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:31,995
Thank you for asking it.

726
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,840
Lindsey Miller: It may not have an
easy answer, but that's the point of

727
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,060
having this conversation, I think right?

728
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,610
Is continuing to bring this topic
up, um, until we do have answers.

729
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,940
Um, so anyway, just wanted
to throw that out there.

730
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,970
Um, what's our next question.

731
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,689
Kim Coleman: Oh, great.

732
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,390
I was just going to add my
son at their school they have

733
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,799
an interesting wall hanging.

734
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:59,729
That's a weaving and there's
kids brought in found objects and

735
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:01,770
they included an old keyboard.

736
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,339
And I think like a computer
mouse, some interesting things.

737
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:08,939
So while we won't all make art out of
our unused cables, it's an option and

738
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:13,109
something that kids are even seeing, you
know, as beautiful and, and recreate.

739
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,660
So cool thanks.

740
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,360
Um, add this question from Fahim,
uh, what are some alternatives to

741
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,440
Google analytics you mentioned, um,
that it may not be needed and it's

742
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,630
kind of a heavy load on a site.

743
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,490
Do you have some preferences
you can recommend?

744
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,450
Hannah Smith: Absolutely.

745
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:28,810
I do.

746
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,140
Thank you for the question Fahim.

747
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,300
I wanted to put it in my talk, but
there was so much to talk through so I'm

748
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,950
glad that we can talk about this now.

749
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,775
Um, A couple of options.

750
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:44,525
There's plausible analytics
and fathom analytics.

751
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:49,295
Now I believe that both are paid for
services, but the thing is with Google,

752
00:45:49,295 --> 00:45:54,694
like they are giving us stuff for
free, but it's not free to society.

753
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:59,674
Somebody somewhere is paying for that
society as a whole is paying for.

754
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,595
Now that's a real moral thing.

755
00:46:02,105 --> 00:46:07,680
Um, It's not always something that a small
startup or a small charity wants to hear.

756
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,880
Um, so a free option at the
moment is called cabin analytics.

757
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,180
I love cabin analytics, their
analytics loads in like, I think

758
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,470
it's less than two kilobits.

759
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,460
Whereas I think Google analytics
is like somewhere between 60 and

760
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,920
80, like massive, big difference.

761
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,690
Um, so having a look at a cabin
now they're in beta at the moment,

762
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,170
which is why the service is free.

763
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:36,025
If you get in there quickly, and then an
open source option is  matoma analytics.

764
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:37,035
I think I've said that, right?

765
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:41,595
My tone, my Toma Miitomo it's either
an OER and a at the end, their

766
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:43,995
analytics is entirely open source.

767
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:47,685
So you can actually run that
yourself, but it requires a lot

768
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,455
more effort than Google analytics.

769
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:54,405
So if you're techie, you might get
on well with Miitomo Metova I hope

770
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:56,235
somebody will correct me on which it is.

771
00:46:56,625 --> 00:47:01,485
Um, I think they do also offer
a subscription as a service

772
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,715
type type thing as well.

773
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:06,165
So there are options out there and
within the WordPress community as well.

774
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:09,975
There's one more that I should mention,
which is Koko analytics, which is a

775
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:16,725
free plugin, um, written by the same
guy that does the main MailChimp plugin.

776
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:19,725
Ah, his name's gone out
of my head at the moment.

777
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:20,925
I remember on my drive home.

778
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:21,315
I'm sure.

779
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,615
Probably have a look at Koko analytics.

780
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:28,935
If you just want simple information
about page loads, Koko is a really

781
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:32,505
great choice, but you need something
more in depth than more complex.

782
00:47:32,505 --> 00:47:34,605
You're probably looking
at plausible or fathom.

783
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:36,055
I mentioned that at the beginning.

784
00:47:39,915 --> 00:47:40,545
Lindsey Miller: Perfect.

785
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:42,455
Thank you so much for
answering that for us.

786
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,635
There's a lot of you mentioned,
I hadn't heard of any of those

787
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,755
analytics programs, so, um, thank you.

788
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,795
I will definitely be
Googling them afterwards.

789
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:52,175
Hannah Smith: Um, and we'll do.

790
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,120
Uh, just say Lindsey on that point
as well, that not only have a

791
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,720
more efficient programs to use,
but they also care a little more

792
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,850
about privacy as well in Google.

793
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,660
So for those of us, and, you know,
in Europe, thinking about things

794
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,140
like GDPR, we're being pushed a bit
more in that direction, but there

795
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,840
is that added benefit of privacy.

796
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,110
Um, better privacy, um, handling as well.

797
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,040
Anyway, we could like do analytics.

798
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:27,955
Lindsey Miller: We could, and the
WordPress person is Danny Van Kooten.

799
00:48:28,585 --> 00:48:29,035
You're welcome.

800
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:29,965
Kim Coleman: Yeah.

801
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:35,725
And I'm going to close that tab
down so that I'm not loading

802
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:37,355
any anymore on that tab.

803
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,305
Like Googled it.

804
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:39,025
And I closed it.

805
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:46,555
Lindsey Miller: Which gets us into the
next question, which is how do we begin

806
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:52,225
talking about this with our teams, our
colleagues, and anyone else, especially as

807
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:57,535
we're talking about really changing entire
workflows and what people are used to.

808
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:00,685
So what are your suggestions, um,
to approach those conversations?

809
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:03,355
Hannah Smith: I think that's
an excellent conversation.

810
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:09,295
And I think one of the key
things that I've learnt is that.

811
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:13,935
Often, if you just talk about
sustainability for sustainability

812
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:18,405
sake, you'll only get a very small
amount of people that are really

813
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,565
interested in making a difference.

814
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:25,365
But if you talk about it as
sustainability plus performance,

815
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:31,710
plus cost-saving plus making it more
accessible plus improving the UX.

816
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,360
If you talk about it in all of
those ways, you are far more

817
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,710
likely for people to go, right?

818
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:37,920
Yeah.

819
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,350
So basically we just need
to kind of do better.

820
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,810
And I find that that's a really great
way to get the conversation going.

821
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,090
I didn't get time to really talk about
all the tools, which is a shame, but

822
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:56,170
there's a fantastic tool called website
carbon calculator, websitecarbon.com.

823
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,090
And the creator of that Tom Greenwood
was giving a talk this morning.

824
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,680
Maybe it came up in Tom's talk.

825
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,310
I bet it did.

826
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:06,420
Um, a really fun thing that you can
do as a team is just put your website

827
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:12,020
in that tool and it will tell you what
the carbon emissions are of that site.

828
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,425
And again, I think like when I've tried
to engage people in the topic for the very

829
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:22,515
first time using that little measurement
tool is great because it tells you not

830
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:25,695
only does it give you a number, but
it tells you how good or bad your site

831
00:50:25,695 --> 00:50:27,225
is compared to the rest of the world.

832
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,759
And it's green, if you do well, and
it's red, if you're not doing so good

833
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:36,720
and, and people often go, oh my gosh,
like we had no idea it was this bad.

834
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,160
Um, and that can galvanize a bit
of motivation and action as well.

835
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,910
Lindsey Miller: Yeah, it reminds
me of, um, there's a WordPress

836
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:49,960
agency in Texas called cause
labs that Cheryl Gillihan owns.

837
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,390
And I wonder if.

838
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:56,444
She and others, like her could make that
part of their process, even with our

839
00:50:56,444 --> 00:51:02,504
clients is like in the, um, discovery
phase or the pitch phase of saying

840
00:51:02,504 --> 00:51:06,254
we ran it through this calculator
because that therapy court right.

841
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:06,484
And so.

842
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:10,905
That's what they're, um, part
of their mission is focused on.

843
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:15,315
And so adding that as part of your,
um, space could be really interesting.

844
00:51:15,315 --> 00:51:16,785
So thanks for sharing that.

845
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:18,675
Hannah Smith: An absolute pleasure.

846
00:51:18,735 --> 00:51:21,735
And the other thing that website
carbon calculator have as well

847
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:24,825
as a little badge that you can
put in the footer of your site.

848
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:28,935
And we'll give you, um, a
carbon emission in the footer

849
00:51:28,965 --> 00:51:30,825
for each single page as well.

850
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,835
So is ongoing measurement.

851
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,305
That can be quite useful too.

852
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:35,565
And just making sure.

853
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:40,845
Um, yeah, your emissions, are you
keeping an eye on, but yeah, I love

854
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:44,895
the idea of including, including it in
the delivery, in the discovery phase.

855
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,335
I think that's a great suggestion.

856
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:49,055
Kim Coleman: Awesome.

857
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:51,065
We might have time for one or two more.

858
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:54,215
So I'm going to throw this one in,
um, since we're all more working

859
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:58,265
remote these days, have you seen any
positive or negative impact on the

860
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:02,435
sustainability and digital technology
as we've moved to working from our

861
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:04,145
independent homes and environments?

862
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:09,960
Hannah Smith: Hmm.

863
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,550
That's a really great question.

864
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,950
And I don't think anybody's
really asked me that before.

865
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:21,600
Um, I do wonder whether we have
started to question how much

866
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,790
digital technology is in our lives.

867
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,460
Certainly for my own experience in lock
down, I existed entirely in the digital

868
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,380
arena, as I'm sure many of you did.

869
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,810
It's the only way I was talking
to people and the only way I

870
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,009
was speaking with my clients.

871
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:41,040
So I wonder perhaps whether there's been
a bit more of a wake up of gosh, you know,

872
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,160
digital technology everywhere in our life.

873
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:49,080
And certainly we're having more
conversations and, you know, Big Orange

874
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,340
Heart are having those conversations as
well about mental health and the impacts

875
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,500
of digital technology on mental health.

876
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,400
Mental health does have
a link to sustainability.

877
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,320
You know, I was talking
about these social issues.

878
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,800
It may not be like a really like
obvious, strong link, but there

879
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,350
is a relationship there as well.

880
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:15,200
So I mean, Beyond that I, I
couldn't really say whether I'd

881
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,520
seen a sort of specifically.

882
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,870
Um, specific spin one way or the other,
but it's an excellent question and one

883
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,100
I'll have a little think on, um, might
pop back up with a blog post on that.

884
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,879
Kim Coleman: And if you love to read
that, I would love to read that.

885
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:32,819
I think a lot of people during the
pandemic, while they did absorb

886
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:35,640
themselves in more technology,
I think they found these like

887
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,560
non-tech hobbies that they nurtured.

888
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,830
And, um, I've seen more
conversations about that stuff then

889
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,509
bingeing, Netflix every day, so.

890
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:43,560
Hannah Smith: Oh, good.

891
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:44,580
Well, that's good for everyone.

892
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:44,939
I think.

893
00:53:51,555 --> 00:53:52,245
Lindsey Miller: Well, awesome.

894
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:53,745
I think we're out of time.

895
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:57,585
Um, Hannah, thank you so much
for your presentation today and

896
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:59,325
answering all of our questions.

897
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:01,905
Um, and we'll continue the
conversation on Twitter.

898
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:02,985
Hannah Smith: Excellent.

899
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:03,795
I hope so.

900
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:05,255
Tap me up.

901
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:09,845
If you want to chat any more about surf,
if you want advice on things I'm always

902
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:14,525
happy to share, um, and always happy to
strike up conversations with people too.

903
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:16,025
This is an important topic.

904
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:19,865
So, you know, let's chat as a
community and, and, and make some

905
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,154
moves in the right direction.

906
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:22,985
Lindsey Miller: Yep.

907
00:54:23,015 --> 00:54:23,615
Perfect.

908
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:24,785
Thank you so much.

909
00:54:25,235 --> 00:54:25,475
Thanks.

910
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:25,835
Okay.

911
00:54:25,835 --> 00:54:26,615
We want to make sure that.

912
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:28,575
And tell our sponsors.
