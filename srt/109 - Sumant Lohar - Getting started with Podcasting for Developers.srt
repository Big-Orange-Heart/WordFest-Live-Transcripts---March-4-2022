00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,350
We want to get started with
podcasting and I'm a developer myself.

37

49
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:49,374
So, but

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,174
Sumant Lohar: Namaste a warm
welcome to all of you to this

51
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:56,034
amazing session for today.

52
00:03:56,484 --> 00:04:00,864
Today, we are going to talk about getting
started with podcasting for developers.

53
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:06,924
And I'm Sumant your company, and
we'll take you through the entire

54
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:11,274
process of starting your own
podcast, even if you are a developer.

55
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,894
So let's get started.

56
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:17,274
I spent, you know, least time
on introduction because more

57
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:21,864
than introduction, the main area
is to learn about podcasting.

58
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:27,775
So basically I'm a tech blogger or content
and social media strategist, video content

59
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,195
creator, which had a speaker at various.

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,880
Podcaster at the idea.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,580
Well, content, so I so I Sumant Lohar
now welcome to this amazing session.

62
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,299
So here are some of the amazing, you
know, agent for today, and we are

63
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:50,070
going to see one by one, all of them
and explore all the opportunities.

64
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:56,935
What is the first thought that comes to
mind while we are starting with podcast.

65
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:01,795
So I got this first amazing and
inspiring thought from Pat Flynn,

66
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,865
who is a well-known podcaster.

67
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:08,065
He sees that the riches
are in the niches friends.

68
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:11,305
You all are almost, I assume that in this.

69
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:17,710
Working as a developer or maybe a
designer and a CSS, a specialist,

70
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,750
a blogger, or a marketer.

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,289
So if you see that, the way you
focus on one niche, you get, you

72
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,719
know, grow, growing and growing.

73
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,810
So the way you are, you know,
making it a statement, it says

74
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,070
the riches are in the niche.

75
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:41,289
So if you just stick to one or two niche,
you can be rich the way you want it.

76
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,499
Okay, now let's get into the
basics of the podcasting first.

77
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,435
Let's say a first history.

78
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,365
You know that from our forefathers,
we have been listening that they

79
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:58,015
used to, uh, listen to all the
audio part through gramophone.

80
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:02,825
And then we came with her antique
radio then came tape recorder.

81
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
Sony Walkman, which we used to put
in our ear and take it everywhere,

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,640
video audio castte, and then can be
apple iPod MP3 players, where you

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,370
can store 300 more than 300 songs.

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,700
Right.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,370
But all of this was replaced by a
smartphone where you can do multiple

86
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,219
things, audio, video, social media,
marketing, you know, messaging everything.

87
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,060
So what is the definition of.

88
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:35,844
Podcast is an audio format available on
different distribution platforms, which

89
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:40,405
is downloadable that makes it convenient
for the people to listen to them while

90
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:45,835
traveling for other activity hours, daily
workouts, or while relaxing at home.

91
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,815
This can be published on website.

92
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,365
YouTube social media platforms.

93
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:53,305
So it's something that you
can download them from the

94
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,284
various distribution platforms.

95
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,104
These are not the social media platforms.

96
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,575
These are the platforms like
Spotify, Google podcasts, and those

97
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:05,935
where they can download them and
listen at your own convenience.

98
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:06,594
So.

99
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,030
What is the importance of podcasting?

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,969
It is usually in a series of podcasts.

101
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,190
So you, how, like, for example, if we
are talking about, let's say Gutenberg

102
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,380
editor, so it takes into different
series, like one to 10 and then 10 to 20.

103
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,710
Okay.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,689
Again, you can have the variations
and do that different podcast.

105
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:34,780
Now this few points are very
much, uh, of importance, right?

106
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,580
It is a niche based.

107
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,120
So if you have forecasting
generalized away, maybe you get

108
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,669
an audience at a lesser pace.

109
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,510
But if we are focusing on, let's
say you are a tech, but that person.

110
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,110
Focus on tech tech things.

111
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,809
If you are, you know, related to fashion
industry folk focus on fashion industry.

112
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,200
So that's how you slowly,
slowly grow in this area.

113
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,580
It gives you immersive experience while
listening, you know, you, while you are

114
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,350
listening to each podcast, you have the
combination of audio, uh, you know, the

115
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,950
sound effects the voice off a broadcaster.

116
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,310
So that gives a very soothing
effect, that relaxing effect,

117
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,200
where you can listen to them any.

118
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:23,005
It's a conversational, it's not a, you
know, very serious matter or something

119
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,815
which, uh, makes you, uh, that you
are to concentrate on that time.

120
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:30,925
It's a conversational, it's a
casual form of delivering content.

121
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,195
Now next, no barriers for listening.

122
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:38,095
You can listen to them while
walking, running, traveling,

123
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,045
eating, or even relaxing, right.

124
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:44,155
Everyone enjoying with friends
as well, access them for free.

125
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:45,835
What does this mean?

126
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:50,185
All of the podcast, genders
today are available for free.

127
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:54,055
Of course you can listen to them,
but there are some premium channels

128
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:58,945
as well, where you have to subscribe
on a monthly basis or yearly

129
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,565
basis, and you can listen to them.

130
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:05,035
That's what we call about
as a membership right now.

131
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,895
What is the punchline of podcast?

132
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,945
It's the new normal for
travelers and commuters.

133
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,935
If you are traveling to any part of
the world, so you can listen to what.

134
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:20,860
If you are a commuter commuter
means from home to your workplace or

135
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,420
somewhere where you're going for a
job or you're going for your business

136
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,730
or something, that's how you travel.

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,500
And you listen to podcasts, you
know, utilizing that precious.

138
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,585
Next, this is very important.

139
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:39,055
You can take the screenshot of
this because, uh, you know, when

140
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:44,365
we talk about podcast, so you need
to be very clear with what type

141
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:46,555
of podcast you want to start with.

142
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:52,675
So we have solo, solo, or monologue,
that means you alone right now, while

143
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,895
I'm talking to you, that's a solo thing.

144
00:09:55,225 --> 00:10:02,480
So that means you can range from 15 to 20
minutes each episode, and you can publish

145
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,300
three to four episodes that depends on
your expertise, your time, convenience,

146
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,000
and the way you want to deliver it.

147
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,890
Second is host and co-host, you may
be seeing in this particular word,

148
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,690
WordPress, because that makes you very.

149
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:19,905
Uh, you know, you can relate with that.

150
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:23,025
You see that there is a
host and there's a cohost.

151
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:27,075
So when their conversation and they're
introducing to a new guest, so that's

152
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:29,325
how it's a host and co-host part.

153
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:34,755
And that, uh, you know, ranges from
20 to 25 minutes, you can publish

154
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:37,635
weekly two to three episodes, right?

155
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,944
Interview you, you invite.

156
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:43,755
Within your industry, like, let's
say you are a developer WordPress

157
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:49,065
developer, and you invite someone else,
uh, you know, WordPress developer from

158
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:54,675
another company and you gain to, uh,
ask them different questions around

159
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:59,385
their methodology, what challenges they
face and what are the tools they use.

160
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:03,705
So that's how you make it more
impactful and influential.

161
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,345
So that ranges from 35 to 45.

162
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:12,945
And at least you can, uh, publish one to
two episodes per week panel discussion.

163
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:19,095
If you have people around, let's
say a two or three or four guest for

164
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:24,735
your podcast, you can hell around
50 to 75 minutes of each episode

165
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,045
and you can publish one episode of.

166
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:33,505
Storytelling storytelling is, uh,
not something like solo stories.

167
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:39,025
So storytelling is something about sharing
about the people of others, or you take it

168
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:43,855
something about, uh, you know, considering
the, uh, the success stories of others.

169
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:47,665
So in that way, you can, uh,
you know, share your thoughts

170
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,955
as 15 to 20 minutes range.

171
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,130
And weekly three episodes
or even two episodes.

172
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,110
Last one is a fusion one.

173
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,030
Well, this word is given by me.

174
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,590
So why I wanted to make it very, uh,
you know, impactful and something that,

175
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,870
uh, you know, you can easily remember.

176
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,600
So fusion is something.

177
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,280
Where you are not sure about whether
you want to go for podcast, which

178
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,510
is solo or interview, you can do
combination of all the above things.

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,300
So you can have that combination
and people will love it.

180
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,400
So based on the feedback of the, of
your audience slowly you grow, and

181
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,990
that's how you make it impactful.

182
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,960
And that ranges from 20 to 30 minutes.

183
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,760
And depending upon the frequency
you can publish on a week basis.

184
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,730
Is, this is something very important.

185
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,480
Now, here is the real journey
that starts for you, right?

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,180
Is this good time to start podcasting?

187
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,830
Yes, definitely.

188
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,390
So what is the first step?

189
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:46,870
Now?

190
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,360
You are clear that you want
to start with podcasting.

191
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,500
So what is the first step?

192
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,870
Identify your strengths and weaknesses.

193
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,730
See friends, you are developer, and
when you are starting your journey.

194
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:04,000
But you might have identify your
strengths and weaknesses or what you

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,939
might have happened that your seniors
might have advised you for certain,

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
certain things that you are good
at this, you are not good at this.

197
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,069
You need to improve at this area.

198
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,380
So this is the right time to list down
all the things and see for yourself

199
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,840
next while you have listed them.

200
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,160
What steps you for.

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,820
What stops you from
starting with something new?

202
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,630
Always.

203
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,090
This is a question around for everyone.

204
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,160
When you are starting your new journey for
anything, that is something, and that is

205
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,410
one barrier for each and every one of us.

206
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,570
And that is fear, fear of speaking,
fear of running fear of, uh, talking

207
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,730
to someone as fear of networking.

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,880
So this is RD now, what are
different types of fear?

209
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,600
Let's see the next slide we
have fear of exploration.

210
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,740
So is that, uh, uh, assembling with you?

211
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,850
Expiration means you have everything,
but you are not able to bring

212
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,680
up among the people publicly.

213
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,600
So this fear you might be having,
I'm not saying you are having, you

214
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,390
might be having fear of communication.

215
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,220
You are good at everything.

216
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,950
And sometimes you too, the language
barrier sometimes because you

217
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,450
have a shyness, you may be having.

218
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,290
Uh, fear of communication.

219
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,860
You are not able to communicate with
people in a very effective manner.

220
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,580
That's fine.

221
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,790
You just start with something
and slowly you can improve that.

222
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,855
Fear of public speaking.

223
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:33,805
Now see friends today.

224
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:36,205
I'm able to talk in front of you.

225
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:40,015
It's not just because
I, I am, I was expert.

226
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:46,105
I, you know, took this time and learn from
different people within the community.

227
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,555
So while I'm, uh, you know,
learning from the community, I make

228
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,445
mistakes and that's how I grew.

229
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:54,985
And today I'm able to speak in
front of you without any fear.

230
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:59,695
So you can also identify your fear and
you can come out of that knowledge.

231
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,240
You know, friends, uh, sometimes
what happens is you have knowledge,

232
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,530
but you are not confident whether I
should share this publicly or not.

233
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,770
So this also fear, uh, you
know, sometimes, uh, puts

234
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,080
you in a wrong direction.

235
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,360
Fear of, let's say.

236
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:21,895
Uh, point of view, for example,
there is something, uh, on a blog

237
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:27,745
or a statement made by a famous, uh,
influencer or developer or someone,

238
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:32,185
and you want to, you know, write
something, but you fear what if I write?

239
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:38,485
Or what if I talk about a particular
discussion on a podcast or something?

240
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:39,615
So this is how.

241
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:42,075
Fear of planning and execution.

242
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:49,005
You are very good at, you have, you know,
decent years of experience as a developer,

243
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:55,575
but you fear to start, uh, planning and
executing, uh, each episode, where are

244
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,555
you where to start and all those things.

245
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:01,965
Last one is the most important
and most common one fear of ideas.

246
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:05,985
You have everything with you, but
you're, uh, you know, figuring out.

247
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,520
Uh, how to start when to start, what
to start and why should I start?

248
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,170
So that is also the caution.

249
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,660
Like if you are a developer,
why should I start?

250
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,170
So you will get all the
answers in the upcoming slides.

251
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,535
How to overcome the fear of speaking.

252
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:28,885
Now you have identified
different types of fear.

253
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,415
So what is the next one?

254
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:35,155
Networking is the best way that as much
as you network with people that you

255
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:39,895
will come to know that you are gaining
confidence and that confidence will

256
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,905
eventually help you in podcasting.

257
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:47,745
As well, so always network
friends, even today.

258
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:51,945
I do not miss out any conferences
and I network with lots of people

259
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,405
participate in the discussions.

260
00:16:54,615 --> 00:17:00,225
So the more you discuss, the
more you discuss with people

261
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,595
and that's how you grow.

262
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:07,784
And, you know, you make, uh,
your network in a more proper.

263
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:16,899
Grab opportunities to become a speaker
at various grant opportunities to become

264
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,409
a speaker at various meetups and events.

265
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,639
If you are a new one, new,
if you are someone who is

266
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,680
very shy in sharing publicly.

267
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:32,905
And do not fear, you know, become
a speaker and let's make a mistake.

268
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:37,045
It's not something you can give
everything in the first shot, right?

269
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:41,545
So slowly, slowly, you grow, listen
to various podcasts to understand

270
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:44,605
the flow of delivering a speech
right now, you are a developer.

271
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:48,925
So there are lots of people, even
within WordPress community who

272
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:52,285
have started their podcast channel.

273
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,045
So listen to them and take
some inspiration from.

274
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,600
Start your watching loud debates.

275
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,740
Nonpolitical.

276
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,760
Of course I start your
own YouTube channel.

277
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,190
Now, here is something very important
to note when you are starting with

278
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,620
podcast, see friends, uh, it's
always better to start with video.

279
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,100
Why?

280
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,540
Because after all podcasting
is all about audio.

281
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
So the expression of your face.

282
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,370
That automatically reflects
towards your, you know, this

283
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,730
mouth and that comes to the voice.

284
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,100
So it's a psychological thing.

285
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,830
So always start your YouTube channel
and come to the comfort level of

286
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:42,790
speaking to the people through first
video, and then starting with audio

287
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,199
part frequently share videos on
social media platforms about your work

288
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,179
progress experience in new learnings.

289
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,010
If you are working on a project, let's
say, and you, uh, explored a particular

290
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,260
functionality or a feature, but there
are a few things that you cannot express,

291
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,330
or you cannot talk about publicly.

292
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:05,439
That's fine.

293
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,479
But if you come to a challenge or you
help solve something, you can share

294
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,520
with people and take advantage of that.

295
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,810
The more you share with people,
the more networks you get, the

296
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,149
more leads you generate now.

297
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,909
Come out of language barrier, see friends,
podcasting is not just about, uh, uh,

298
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,949
you're not talking about in just English.

299
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:33,310
You can, if you are, uh, you see
today, uh, I'm very fortunate.

300
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:38,250
I feel lucky that I have talking
to people around the world and you

301
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,500
all are from different regions.

302
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,360
You may have different languages.

303
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,939
So you start with that language, right.

304
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:46,725
Be comfort in that.

305
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:49,545
And then you can come to
English and international level.

306
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,145
That's fine.

307
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:55,185
Come out of a language barrier
and never look at people when

308
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,355
they might make fun of you.

309
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:02,835
When you are starting with your
journey, you know what happens?

310
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:09,735
Uh, people make fun of you because
you are they mistake now, who does Mr.

311
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,389
Because you are taking something action.

312
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,479
When you take action, then
only you make mistake, right?

313
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,610
So that's fine.

314
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,289
Be comfortable start working
on it and be consistent.

315
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,289
Be keep working and keep
focusing on yourself.

316
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:33,070
And the last one is be a good listener
along with being a good auditor.

317
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,899
This is also very important.

318
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,320
Now, if I just go on speaking
before luck, uh, let's say one hour,

319
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,179
two hour, it's not going to help.

320
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,980
I also have to listen a lot.

321
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,620
So even today, this is a practice
that I do when I talk with people

322
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:52,270
and listen to their challenges.

323
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,409
First, I, I listened to their
introduction first, and then only I

324
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,460
start with my introduction that helps
me to understand their perspective.

325
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:06,055
So when I understand their perspective,
I can address according to them.

326
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,425
So this is a good practice for everyone.

327
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,000
Next.

328
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,690
Okay.

329
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,940
Now you have overcome the fear next.

330
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,530
You want to start your podcast.

331
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,940
Get that information.

332
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,440
That's the important thing.

333
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:18,790
Listen to podcasts.

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,610
As I said earlier, record your own voice.

335
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,930
Now, when you have started a podcast,
uh, let's say, uh, your YouTube

336
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,180
channel now record your own voice.

337
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,290
I'll talk about different
tools at the very last.

338
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,940
Take feedback from your
friends and seniors.

339
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,970
Keep consistency in networking consistency
in context, that will help you to grow

340
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,620
at a, you know, at a very larger level,
explore topics, trends, and interests.

341
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,940
Don't randomly start
podcasting on different topics.

342
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,730
No learn out, identify topics
on which you are comfortable.

343
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,420
Identify times I did have
a interest of the audience.

344
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,209
For example, you are, uh, on,
let's say on Twitter and you

345
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,159
have 1000 followers with you.

346
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,639
So do not just, uh, uh, start with
something that I'm going to start hell

347
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,050
you know, their feedback, what they
are interested in, learn about their

348
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,699
interests and then start your journey.

349
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,544
So now, Are you excited to
start a new journey for podcast?

350
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,324
Yes.

351
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:33,175
Now next few slides are the most
important one, so never miss out,

352
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:35,784
you know, keep focusing on this.

353
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:40,014
So what are they the reasons to start now?

354
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:45,024
If I, I have been telling you
start your podcast journey, but why

355
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:48,084
you don't need to start, you will
have this question in mind, right?

356
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:51,415
So it's a, one of the most
preferred form of content.

357
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:55,884
Even if you do not have ability
to write blogs, if you do not

358
00:22:55,884 --> 00:23:00,475
have the ability to, um, you know,
work on your videos, that's fine.

359
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:01,975
You can start with podcasting.

360
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:03,685
You can listen to anywhere.

361
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,384
It's the era of multitasking.

362
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:10,854
What is the meaning of the multitasking?

363
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:14,965
So multitasking doesn't mean that,
uh, you do everything at a time.

364
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:20,394
Multitasking means if you are doing some
activity less a year, you're working on

365
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,104
some coding part and you'll feel bored.

366
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,804
So at the same time, you can
even listen to a podcast.

367
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:31,225
So like, listen now, Uh, just imagine
you are starting your own podcast

368
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:37,375
channel and someone other developer,
they want to, uh, get some to podcasts.

369
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:38,905
So they search for you.

370
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:39,265
Okay.

371
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:43,105
This is something that I will do, uh,
listen, and also I want to work on.

372
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,060
Now that's a, uh, you know, multitask
and, uh, they will find it very useful,

373
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,520
has lot of potential to generate leads.

374
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,790
As I said earlier, forecasting has lot of,
uh, you know, uh, potential to generate

375
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,980
leads and to make connections, but it
takes a lot of time with team based

376
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,410
medium to build a relationship with.

377
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,899
Businesses, whether it is agency owners,
whether it is enterprises, whether it is

378
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:17,199
it companies or even Browns, they want to
invite you, or they want to collaborate

379
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:20,889
with you because you are delivering
something very valuable to them.

380
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,500
Opportunity to be guest or not.

381
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,350
This podcast series see
friends, if you want to grow.

382
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,459
Okay, that's fine.

383
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:34,090
You are starting your podcast series,
but also apparently simultaneously focus

384
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,909
on being a guest on different platforms.

385
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,199
Uh, and, uh, you know, you
do not have to be doing.

386
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,889
By yourself slowly and steadily while you
share a good, valuable content with them,

387
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:51,489
they will, uh, reach out to you as today.

388
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,709
Even today, people reach out to me for,
uh, you know, interviewing or for getting,

389
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:03,264
uh, you know, Uh, let's say published on
their articles, like blogs or something.

390
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:08,394
So I hope almost a given my interview
on two to three podcast channels.

391
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:09,864
So that's how you grow.

392
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:12,054
You share your address with their guest.

393
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:16,014
Now podcast has just
opened up a long way to go.

394
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:16,945
What does this mean?

395
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:22,584
It's not that it's just how
awkward, but you have so much to

396
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,445
share with people through podcast.

397
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,889
And that's where it makes it very
unique from different forms of

398
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:34,570
content today, forecasts episodes
are available in different languages

399
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,779
for various niches market is here.

400
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,614
So what's the next.

401
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,014
Now you will know that.

402
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:48,084
What are the reasons now, second
question that may arise in your mind

403
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:53,094
is should I use website development,
team development and plugin

404
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,925
development to start with podcasts?

405
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:58,860
Because podcasting has
its own process, right?

406
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,560
Recording, editing, and everything.

407
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:07,350
So that does mean that you have to
live your, uh, present, uh, uh, you

408
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,719
know, business or a job or something.

409
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:17,310
No, you do not have to live that, but in
fact, forecasting improves your knowledge.

410
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,919
It helps you in personal branding.

411
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:20,820
It has.

412
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,929
Gaining confidence, talking to
people, the removes fear of public

413
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,360
speaking, no one is there to see you.

414
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:28,750
Yeah.

415
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,120
When you are recording a voice,
no one is there to see you or

416
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,919
judge you how you are looking.

417
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,020
See it the way you are speaking.

418
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,780
No, it's all dependent on your voice.

419
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,360
So you have to only work on just one area.

420
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,320
And that is what.

421
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,094
You have a dead areas.

422
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:50,154
Sound is that, uh, you
know, the volume is there.

423
00:26:50,154 --> 00:26:53,455
That's different, but you have
only one focus that is audio.

424
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:57,354
Part process is easy at first.

425
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:03,024
You might find it very difficult, but
as in V when you progress, it will,

426
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,975
uh, you know, uh, look very easy.

427
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:08,665
Abs in business growth.

428
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:09,354
Yeah.

429
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:12,925
If you are doing business, let's
say freelancing, if you are doing,

430
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:17,394
or if you are an individual, this
helps a lot in your business as well.

431
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:20,004
You scope of various topics to talk about.

432
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,044
It's not just about one or two topics.

433
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:25,614
You have a lot of industry you
have today in, uh, even in,

434
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,314
uh, WordPress community itself.

435
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,225
We have so much to talk about.

436
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:35,665
From the perspective of marketing from the
perspective of SEO, from the perspective

437
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:41,185
of, uh, let's say, uh, front-end
back-end and everything is there, right?

438
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:44,095
So can be a form of giving
back to the community.

439
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:48,865
See friends, uh, community is giving
us in a lot of different models.

440
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:55,314
But, uh, when we share with people
through, uh, podcasting is we share

441
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:59,965
knowledge, we share our experience,
we share our challenges and we

442
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:03,774
invite some of the famous people
or some well-known people or people

443
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:07,824
who are working in community day
and night, if you invite them.

444
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:12,834
So you see you are in the form of you are
giving them back to the community right?

445
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:14,844
Next.

446
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,445
What is podcasting for developers?

447
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:23,815
Now we all ready, talked about
fear and everything, but actually,

448
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:26,095
what is forecasting for developers?

449
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:28,375
It improves work efficiency.

450
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,159
When you collaborate with others or
when you take interviews with others

451
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,169
or when you, uh, you know, listen to
podcast, you get to know a lot of things.

452
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:44,919
You, you, uh, explore different resources,
you explore different methods, you explore

453
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,469
different, uh, functionality to send fi.

454
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,159
Among the WordPress community itself.

455
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,229
So this is something very important.

456
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:58,629
Get broader idea about themes, plugins for
press lettuce updates, get to know about

457
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:01,539
other developers, their methodology tools.

458
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,129
They use challenges.

459
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:04,989
They have best practices.

460
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:06,699
Stand out from the crowd.

461
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,330
You are a developer, you are
doing something amazing within

462
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,439
the WordPress community.

463
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,320
And I believe you all are doing amazing.

464
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,600
Not just one person
you all are doing with.

465
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:21,774
Uh, something which is a commendable,
but if you are starting your

466
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:26,334
podcast journey in the beginning,
you might face a lot of challenges.

467
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:31,644
You might, uh, how the fear that's
fine, but when you get going with

468
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:36,715
that, You, if people would recognize
in that form, that this person is

469
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:41,845
also a developer and a podcaster as
well, people will want you to give

470
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:45,205
advices as an expert on their podcast.

471
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:49,315
So they will invite you as
an, uh, you know, someone who

472
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:51,685
will, uh, give them advice.

473
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:55,554
For example, I went to give a very
simple example, a quick example.

474
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,955
Let's say you are in a growing stage.

475
00:29:57,985 --> 00:29:59,935
You just started with one or two episodes.

476
00:30:00,205 --> 00:30:01,315
People love to listen to it.

477
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,660
And you get the invitation from
a, another podcast channel who

478
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,690
is having around 10,000 to 15,000
audience regularly watching each

479
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,520
episode or listening to them.

480
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,150
Now, just see the impact
you are giving them.

481
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,280
You are going there as a guest, you are
sharing your knowledge and the response

482
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,040
you get, or people will approach you.

483
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,710
It's just unimaginable, right?

484
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:36,625
You can focus in that manner, better
visibility among the people down yourself

485
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:42,145
from knowledge equity to knowledge
provider right now, while you do not

486
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,395
have much knowledge about podcasting.

487
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:49,705
Uh, so you are getting knowledge,
you know, you're acquiring no.

488
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:54,759
Once you get the steps once, you
know, the process of podcasting.

489
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:58,540
And when you share with other
people, that's where you

490
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,699
become knowledge provider.

491
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:07,149
So see that transformation from knowledge
equator to knowledge provider next.

492
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:12,580
Now this is something very,
uh, much of your useful.

493
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,919
This is something very useful resources.

494
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:20,499
You can listen to some of this
podcast, uh, on, at your convenience.

495
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,050
First one is pat Flynn to who even I
follow on a regular basis and I are

496
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,899
learned so much of things from him.

497
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,209
So I highly recommend
to learn from scratch.

498
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:31,719
If you don't have.

499
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,410
Any of the steps to start with podcasting,
you can start listening to pat Flynn.

500
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,020
Gary Vernicek, we know is good at branding
and different aspects of marketing.

501
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,960
Tim Ferris set called in who, uh, he
runs like a akimbo or cuss channel.

502
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,240
Do the VU from the WordPress community.

503
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,620
We have WVU is a to Zed WP coffee talk.

504
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,240
The guiding was which.

505
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:03,759
Oh, it's focused on interviewing, uh,
it professionals and other experts from

506
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,469
various industries around the world.

507
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:09,189
Post status forecast, your website aging.

508
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:12,729
So these are the, some of the,
uh, well-known, uh, forecast.

509
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,909
And I think that if you refer them,
you'll get to know a lot of things now.

510
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:27,215
This is something of the real
formula, or you can say the

511
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:29,075
real ingredient of podcasting.

512
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:31,055
You can take the screenshot of this.

513
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:35,465
I have been working in most of,
uh, I have been working on some of

514
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,445
the tools and still I'm exploring.

515
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:39,825
So there are some things that.

516
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,240
Uh, uh, you know, that keeps changing
and even as they change the features

517
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,919
functionalities and all those things.

518
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:51,669
So you have recording and editing
where you can use garage band

519
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:56,860
and logic pro for Mac or sat, or
the Adobe audition for windows.

520
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:59,439
You have zoom and Skype
for recording purpose.

521
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:03,909
You have designing for Canva, Adobe
illustrator, Adobe spark Raila,

522
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:07,899
wispy post, a podcast distribution,
where you can distribute.

523
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,095
Recorded and completed episodes.

524
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:16,075
So these are the, uh, areas where
you can start with anchor.fm.

525
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:16,405
Why?

526
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:21,145
Because it allows you to
distribute into multiple channels.

527
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:28,525
But, uh, uh, you can also learn to, uh,
distribute separately manually, right?

528
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:33,535
You have podcasters streaming platforms
where all the podcast episodes will be

529
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:36,235
streamed, uh, for all of your channel.

530
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:41,379
And when you want to get your, uh,
you know, sound effects or let's

531
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:45,519
say a background music you can get
from the YouTube's audio library,

532
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,939
music for content creator, you can
search this and you can get that.

533
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,409
And the book that the heart
of the podcasting planning

534
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:55,179
and execution is mind map.

535
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:57,309
So you can use whimsical or mine.

536
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,870
Mister, I use whimsical.

537
00:33:58,899 --> 00:33:59,259
Why?

538
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,209
Because it's very simple.

539
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,669
You just have to plan
out the anti-oppressive.

540
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:11,245
Just think I, you know, uh, how,
uh, plan of, uh, exit complete, uh,

541
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:13,705
execution from the scratch level.

542
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:20,545
So it's a like, uh, research work,
inviting guest, uh, execution marketing.

543
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,830
Distribution editing all episodes,
recording all episodes, title, everything.

544
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,730
Is there, uh, for me at, uh, mind maps.

545
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:37,450
So use for yourself also slowly, slowly,
you know, first, uh, you know, you, uh,

546
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,890
create smaller mindmaps and then you.

547
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:46,105
And before I, uh, you know, tell about
or share about this monster thought in

548
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:51,625
the end, I would highly recommend when
you are recording your voice or you are

549
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:57,025
starting your podcast channel, do not plan
to start with 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

550
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:00,255
Always start with two to three
minutes because that's your,

551
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:02,995
your space to grow, to improve.

552
00:35:03,295 --> 00:35:05,695
And, uh, to find out that
where you are lacking.

553
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:10,765
Because if you are starting for 10, 15
minutes, you have large, huge scope you

554
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:13,555
at right now, you do not need huge scope.

555
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:17,845
You need to take action for forecasting.

556
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,405
So this a last thought, something
that I want to share with you, good

557
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:27,055
ideas are common, but those who are
willing to take action and execute

558
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,725
those ideas are far more rare.

559
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:30,865
What does this mean?

560
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:34,315
You have, we all have, uh,
ideas which are very common.

561
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,470
Who all take action and execute them.

562
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,180
Those ideas become rarest
thing in today's world.

563
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,190
This is again by pat Flynn.

564
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,630
Well-known podcaster.

565
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,370
So that's it from me.

566
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,320
Thank you for your precious time.

567
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:55,180
I highly appreciate your time
spending on this particular session.

568
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,500
So thank you and namaste from India.

569
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,595
Yogesh Londhe: I see you here.

570
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:09,775
What did you say?

571
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,834
Lax Mariappan: That that was a good talk.

572
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:14,335
Very encouraging, motivating.

573
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:19,495
And thanks for putting all the, uh, all
the questions that a beginner might have

574
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:23,125
answered everything in the slides already.

575
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:26,845
Yogesh Londhe: So Lax, by the
way, in just distracting from the

576
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,765
topic that I'm just loving that.

577
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,640
You know WordFest, uh, that you get
the bite, the music it's very catchy,

578
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,770
you know, 24 hours, 60 sessions,
one community it's very engaging.

579
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,530
And, uh, Sumant mentioned about, uh,
finding, uh, copyright free music.

580
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,820
Copy, left music in.

581
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:49,960
Yeah.

582
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,120
So we've got few questions for someone.

583
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:52,930
Yes.

584
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,450
Lax.

585
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,150
Uh, you want to go with
the first question?

586
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,150
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

587
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:04,410
So, uh, you know, podcasting is, um,
it's also like, uh, blogging or like

588
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,710
there's a lot of competition that
are already established podcasts.

589
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,460
So how do a developer or
someone who's just starting

590
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,320
out, make a podcast, stand out.

591
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:15,730
Sumant Lohar: Yeah.

592
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:20,680
So, as I said earlier, there are so many
resources within WordPress community.

593
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,850
You can refer them.

594
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,950
And apart from that, you can start
with just two, two to three episodes

595
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,000
and publish on just Audacity.

596
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,960
And once you publish that, and when
you share with your friends or your,

597
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,090
uh, let's say, uh, your companions,
companions, and that's how you come to

598
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,385
know that where are the areas that you
need to improve because at first shot.

599
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:50,185
If you just, uh, go on distributing on
different channels, there'll be a little,

600
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,795
uh, space for the improvement part.

601
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,295
Yogesh Londhe: Okay.

602
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:57,925
That's nice.

603
00:37:57,955 --> 00:37:58,315
Okay.

604
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:04,465
Um, now, and I have a question
how to promote my podcast.

605
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:06,685
I have made a proud
podcast how to promote it.

606
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,725
I would do the same thing.

607
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,165
I think it's the same question.

608
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:12,025
So we'll go to the next question.

609
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:12,865
Yeah.

610
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,150
Well, I will put, put a question to you.

611
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,530
Yeah.

612
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,830
What kind of debates and
podcasts do you listen to?

613
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,330
Um, in what languages?

614
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,600
Sumant Lohar: Uh, usually I listen
to podcasts in a Hindi and English

615
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,000
languages, uh, and the debates are
around, uh, let's say, uh, the,

616
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,790
uh, cross border, uh, discussing.

617
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:41,165
Or maybe let's say around,
uh, technology part.

618
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,945
We, we have seen that in the
recent, uh, just few months

619
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,865
we have seen Meta Verse there.

620
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:51,965
And a lot of other technology has come
up, but, uh, are we ready for that?

621
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:58,895
So, uh, the experts, uh, talk very
nicely with an example, how to be ready

622
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:00,965
with all those upcoming technologies.

623
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:07,735
Yogesh Londhe: Okay, so you listen to
Hindi and, uh, uh, how so, how about,

624
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,625
how about the podcasts in Hindi?

625
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:14,655
Like, is there, uh, English has lot
of possible podcasts, but how many

626
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:18,195
podcasts are they in Hindi or Gujarati?,

627
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:23,125
Sumant Lohar: uh, see uh, compared
to of course English is the most, uh,

628
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:28,945
uh, preferred one, but even, uh, as
of last three months, if you count

629
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:35,575
so regional languages, uh, podcasts
are in demand, huge demand and people

630
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:39,025
are still in fear how to start them.

631
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:43,955
If they start, they will get huge
popularity from the beginning itself.

632
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:45,790
Yogesh Londhe: Okay.

633
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,340
Lax, any questions?

634
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,740
We can't hear you, your mic is off.

635
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,610
Lax Mariappan: Okay.

636
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,850
So maybe I muted my mic.

637
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,330
So, uh, it's almost the same question.

638
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,500
So what do you recommend or what do
you, uh, yeah, what do you recommend?

639
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,190
Like someone should start broadcasting
their language, like in their

640
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,380
mother tongue I am from Tamil Nadu.

641
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,210
I speak Tamil more fluently, so I should
start a podcast in Tamil, or I can try

642
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,630
English or like other popular language?

643
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,520
Sumant Lohar: Yeah, definitely.

644
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,310
Definitely.

645
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,320
If you start, uh, broadcasting in mother
tongue, you'll be more comfortable, you

646
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,150
know, comfortable and even, uh, you know,
confident because you know something about

647
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,160
your language and if you are starting
in English, what will happen is you will

648
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,900
first be struggling with the process of
podcasting as well as with the language.

649
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,240
So this, uh, uh, difference.

650
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,170
Yogesh Londhe: Okay, so you suggest,
um, mother tongue podcasts should be, it

651
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,940
should take, it should take priority okay.

652
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,570
That's good.

653
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,110
That's good.

654
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,009
Technology podcasts in Tamil
or canada would be amazing.

655
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:00,820
Amazing.

656
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,380
Yeah.

657
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,340
Okay.

658
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,790
Um, Sumant, now.

659
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,390
Okay.

660
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,980
I'll ask a question.

661
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:15,955
Uh, can you give us the popular,
uh, podcasts platforms like people?

662
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:20,845
What kind of platforms do people listen
to sound cloud or, uh, I don't know.

663
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:27,655
Sumant Lohar: So there are platform
platforms, mainly, uh, Spotify

664
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,815
is that apple iTunes is there.

665
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,555
So these are the two platforms.

666
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:36,794
If any of the  podcaster, uh, whether
they are new or the existing one,

667
00:41:37,214 --> 00:41:42,345
if they focus, they will get a huge
popularity in terms of views, in terms

668
00:41:42,345 --> 00:41:44,814
of audience, in terms of downloads.

669
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:46,194
Yogesh Londhe: Okay.

670
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:49,484
Uh, what about, do you see
about this one pocket cast?

671
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:51,134
I, I listened to pocket cast.

672
00:41:51,194 --> 00:41:51,734
I dunno.

673
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:52,634
Yeah.

674
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,325
I, I like the content there too.

675
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:03,825
Um, is there a way to, uh, host
your audio file somewhere and just

676
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,825
let Google do its magic on Google?

677
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:12,375
Because Google has a tool, which a
collates podcast from around the web

678
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:16,785
and just gives you, it's not a platform,
it's just a tool which lets the.

679
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,140
Sumant Lohar: Yeah.

680
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:26,009
So every, every content format has
its own SEO, uh, you know, framework.

681
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,009
So like if you are using a YouTube SEO,
so you have video, uh, uh, part and all

682
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,040
those titles and everything in the same.

683
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:39,395
If you are sharing those audio files
through this platform, which I told you,

684
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:43,115
so they will help to in, in such also.

685
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:48,605
So, but if you randomly upload
somewhere, uh, it might not be

686
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:50,195
recognizable as it should be.

687
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:51,785
Okay.

688
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:52,135
Yogesh Londhe: Okay.

689
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:53,405
Okay.

690
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:57,605
I got my own opinions on
some of the platforms.

691
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,049
Yeah, talk side.

692
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:02,549
We'll listen to your views.

693
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,750
Okay.

694
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,529
Um, yeah.

695
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,700
Lax Mariappan: So far developers,
what are the, some popular

696
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:13,140
podcasts or broadcasters, uh,
that you recommend to listen?

697
00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:19,065
Sumant Lohar: Uh, yeah, as, as, uh, you
know, uh, shared in the slide itself.

698
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:23,355
So there are some, uh, podcasters,
like Do The Woo is also there.

699
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:30,145
And we have, uh, I suppose there is
some, uh, uh, w Elementor or Yoast

700
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:36,315
or other, uh, areas where you can
listen to podcasts and, uh, get

701
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:38,685
updated knowledge from them itself.

702
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:39,045
Yeah.

703
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,504
Yogesh Londhe: Lax, do you listen
to this podcast distributed?

704
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:50,714
Lax Mariappan: Uh, no, but, uh, I
listened to some other WordPress

705
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:57,234
related, like a Post Excerpt from
Post Status, uh, WP Minute from

706
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:58,694
Yogesh Londhe: very nice podcast.

707
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:03,285
It's not a technology, but it
talks a lot about distributed

708
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:05,805
nature of work sometimes.

709
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,140
Uh, the name of the podcast
itself is distributed.

710
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:18,270
It's it's started by some, uh,
angel investor jazz musician.

711
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,650
Okay.

712
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,360
Yeah, it sounds interesting.

713
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,530
Okay.

714
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,650
Okay.

715
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,230
So do we have any other
questions for, uh, Sumant, Lax?.

716
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,430
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

717
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,859
So, um, I have, uh, some questions
like, uh, I mean, can we go with

718
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:43,819
the TLDR version of his talk
or something like, uh, yeah.

719
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,690
It's like, yeah, you can summarize
within another, like, uh, one or

720
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,700
two minutes about like most of the
challenges, like what people, um,

721
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,129
like the common challenges that every.

722
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:02,535
Experience and what should they can
avoid and also how they can monetize

723
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,125
are how they can benefit from it.

724
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,115
So again,

725
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:06,535
Yogesh Londhe: Monetize,
monetize, yeah, monetize.

726
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:09,085
Yes, that's a good question.

727
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:09,515
Sumant Lohar: Yeah.

728
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:13,325
So, uh, first thing is, uh, the
common challenge that, uh, most

729
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:17,975
of the business face is using the
tools because every tool has its own

730
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:20,435
functionality and a different purpose.

731
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:24,745
For example, if you are doing it
for you have recorded and, uh, an

732
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:29,875
episode in a zoom or Skype, and
then you're taking it for editing.

733
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:36,115
So you edit on audacity for windows
and GarageBand on a Mac, but

734
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:40,795
you, how to first learn all the
features and everything around that.

735
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,385
And then only you can move forward.

736
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:46,705
And at the same time talking
about the monetization part.

737
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:53,325
So, uh, say monetization, uh, does not
happen, uh, within one or two months.

738
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:59,674
But slowly, when you go with like 25,
30, 40 episodes and you collaborate

739
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:04,865
with more, more and more, uh, you know,
podcasters, you upper, you know, approach

740
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,145
them or they invite you as guests.

741
00:46:07,174 --> 00:46:11,825
So the collaboration here, the
important element is the collaboration.

742
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:17,015
The more collaborations you have, the more
audience you have, the, you know, to get

743
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,365
better with, uh, the monitorization part.

744
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:23,255
Yogesh Londhe: Okay, thanks for the tips.

745
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:30,935
So, um, so Sumant there is a
question and how to promote podcasts

746
00:46:30,964 --> 00:46:33,125
without installing any apps.

747
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:36,035
Sumant Lohar: Yeah.

748
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:42,365
So, uh, without installing any apps,
I think, uh, you can, uh, you know, be

749
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:48,095
very active on social media platforms,
especially on Instagram and Twitter.

750
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:53,030
Because these are two areas where
you can share with people and talk

751
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,410
about your podcast or what you
are looking at and you have today,

752
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,300
uh, Twitter spaces are so there.

753
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,650
And a lot of other things
also are there in a line, so

754
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,630
you can, uh, share with them.

755
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,550
And apart from that, if you want to,
you know, promote your podcast channel.

756
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:15,590
So along with the audio part,
record them in video part and share.

757
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:19,090
As a video on YouTube channel.

758
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,770
Yogesh Londhe: Okay, great.

759
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,629
So thank you very much Sumant.

760
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:25,700
Sumant Lohar: thank you.

00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:31,279

00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,279
event, Sumant is there to volunteer.
