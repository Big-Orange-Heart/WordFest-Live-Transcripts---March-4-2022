Andrija Radojev: Hey
guys, my name is Andrija.

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,790
And uh, now I want to talk with you
about, uh, uh, how we can automate

58
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:27,280
WooCommerce stores and, uh, use those we
have at our disposal to, uh, to basically

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,070
save time and money, uh, doing complex
WooCommerce tasks that we do every day or

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,890
to resolve, uh, issues that may come up.

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,909
I hope you guys can see my screen.

62
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,490
Okay.

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,930
If somebody can't see my
screen, just let me know.

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,989
Uh, so let's start shall we?

65
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,330
First of all, uh, this
topic will be, yeah.

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,780
Great.

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,549
Uh, so this topic will be particularly
interesting, uh, to WooCommerce

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,870
store owners and managers.

69
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:12,225
Uh, however, it is also a very useful
for WooCommerce developers who regularly

70
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:17,895
work on, uh, improving WooCommerce
stores and, uh, and saying, and,

71
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:20,175
uh, finding ways to, to improve it.

72
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:24,945
Uh, if you have ever worked with
WooCommerce as, uh, technology and

73
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:30,555
the developed the websites then you
probably know that, uh, making certain

74
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:35,295
that, uh, that the, the process is
most efficient is one of the most

75
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,615
challenging tasks of WooCommerce.

76
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,265
Does this, this lecture, uh,
can be also useful for you.

77
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:46,065
And of course I will talk
about some depth technologies.

78
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:47,295
Don't worry, guys.

79
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:48,945
I'm a developer myself.

80
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,325
I did not forget you guys.

81
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:55,575
So we're going to have a
variety of topics to talk about.

82
00:05:55,785 --> 00:06:01,625
And, uh, also, uh, you don't
have to actually be uh, current

83
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:05,195
owner of a WooCommerce store or
working with WooCommerce business.

84
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,765
Everybody who wants to do that,
or to learn something new or

85
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:12,335
doing basically how WooCommerce
and e-commerce technologies work.

86
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,335
Uh, this actually will be
definitely interesting.

87
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:20,375
We are going to share some details
on how commerce stores can operate

88
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:24,320
and, uh, basically, uh, They do that.

89
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,409
You're going to learn something new,
even though, even if you're not directly

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,570
involved with WooCommerce or eCommerce.

91
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,550
So, uh, we are talking about to
commerce today, but why WooCommerce?

92
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,550
Uh, that, that is probably the,
uh, first question, uh, new,

93
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,870
new commerce to WooCommerce
would ask why is it so popular?

94
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,340
Why is it a.

95
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,840
Why don't, why don't
we use something else?

96
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,359
Uh, we can have a WooCommerce site and we
want to set up, uh, we can work the site

97
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,979
and we want to set up a WooCommerce store.

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,289
Why do we choose WooCommerce instantly?

99
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,880
Uh, are there any other, uh, other
plugins that's similar to WooCommerce

100
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,559
and actually, yes, they are.

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,299
However, you can pretty much see
that WooCommerce is a big guy.

102
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:17,095
Uh, takes most the, of the, uh, market.

103
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:22,225
And, uh, you also have Ecwid easy
digital downloads, but as you

104
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,205
can see, they're minority here.

105
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:29,065
So you're mainly going to talk about
WooCommerce, however, uh, the, the

106
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:34,435
tools I will show to you are, uh, most
of them can be implemented, implemented

107
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:36,865
on Ecwid or easy digital downloads.

108
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:43,575
So I'm definitely, uh, so that,
uh, those, uh, E-commerce stores

109
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:45,375
can be automated that way as well.

110
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:51,585
Now, uh, we are talking about a
WooCommerce automation, but we

111
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,475
did not answer the main question.

112
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,215
Uh, why should they help me?

113
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:56,565
They can't have a WooCommerce store.

114
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:57,975
I earn money from it.

115
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:05,355
I, uh, I'm, uh, pretty confident about
my business and I'm, uh, definitely,

116
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:10,485
uh, I'm definitely happy with how it's
going, but why should they help me?

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,210
Uh, I'm not like a big company that
needs a major, a majorly solution.

118
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,710
I'm not, uh, I don't have enough
money to pay for it and I'm pretty

119
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,140
happy with this, with my stats.

120
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,310
Why should I help me?

121
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, uh, even though if you're not
a big company, if you're a small

122
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:37,320
business, if you're just starting off,
if you have, uh, if you have a, like,

123
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:44,415
Just started your business, uh, of,
and you're working for three months

124
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:49,185
you, you should still automate because
if you have aspirations to grow your

125
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:55,005
business or, uh, basically just to have
more time to, uh, develop some more

126
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:59,625
interesting stuff and the basically
invest your time to do something else,

127
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,995
then automation is definitely for you.

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,435
And the first topic that
is very important is.

129
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:12,420
Uh, how much time we do spend, uh,
for updates, you know, a market is

130
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,310
changing prices, changing costs are
changing, and we need to adjust to that.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,515
Uh, our ability to adjust to, uh, To be,
to basically adjust to market changes

132
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:32,415
mainly depends on how much time do we need
to make changes to our website and, uh,

133
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:38,775
how, uh, how responsive are we to the,
to the changes, uh, that that can happen.

134
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:44,084
Uh, that said there are lots
of, uh, things, uh, that.

135
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,944
That can go on.

136
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:48,225
You can, uh, change your supply.

137
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:54,555
Uh, you can, uh, you can, uh, find out
that, uh, sometimes it's changed the

138
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:58,545
overnight and the, that your business
is not so profitable as it used to be.

139
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:00,045
And you need to adjust to that.

140
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:07,844
Uh, you, you basically need to ensure
that you're always evolved in your, that

141
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:12,960
you're always involved, uh, with, with
the market and that, that, uh, That you

142
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,610
can quickly respond to those changes,
having manual, uh, updating, uh, manually

143
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,880
updating the products can be very tricky
and can definitely get to get in your way.

144
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,560
So you're going to definitely
needs to find ways to, uh,

145
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,210
improve or speed up your work.

146
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:40,905
Also when you see that your website
is working fine on your end, that

147
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:46,334
does not necessarily mean that that's,
that is the same for your customer.

148
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:53,385
Uh, and issue detection can definitely
be tricky sometimes, uh, especially

149
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:58,155
if, uh, the issue only targets specific
devices or specific customers, for

150
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:04,525
instance, uh, you might be used to,
uh, working on Google Chrome uh, and

151
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:07,035
using it as your main web browser.

152
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,725
And you're like, okay, I'm using Google
Chrome, it has all the features I have.

153
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:14,285
However, somebody else in the
road might still be using Edge

154
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,285
browser, even internet Explorer.

155
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,230
In some governments, it is still used.

156
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,910
And if you cannot get to those
customers, if they cannot complete

157
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,990
the purchase, post is the CMA you do
then you're basically losing money.

158
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Uh, identifying those errors and
issues is very important in, uh,

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,760
making sure that you are putting
the best of the few business.

160
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:46,230
Another topic that is, uh, very, uh,
commonly, uh, ignored when you, when

161
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,610
you start to WooCommerce business.

162
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:54,194
Uh, his lead management, uh, when
you're having, uh, auto, uh, leads that

163
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:59,954
you need to, uh, to post this somehow
WooCommerce by itself is not enough.

164
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:06,370
Uh, Having all the information you need
about your customers and your leads

165
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,420
is, uh, probably the key, uh, the key
factor in, uh, managing those customers

166
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:19,740
and, uh, uh, and the putting the best
out of them out of, uh, to basically,

167
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,520
uh, ensure that they are going to be
engaged gauge within your business.

168
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,240
And, uh, that, uh, you can, uh, for
instance, quickly spot tissues or find

169
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,160
the ways to improve your business, uh,
that needs to be a two-way process.

170
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,970
So basically you have to always
be in touch with your customers

171
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,660
in order to ensure that that, uh,
you're going to receive the correct

172
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,670
feedback for your specific business.

173
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,330
And, uh, one last thing I
already spoke about it, uh, that

174
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,810
is, uh, basically managing...

175
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,854
let's see something is off here.

176
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:03,765
Oh yeah.

177
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:05,234
Uh, finally.

178
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:05,745
Okay.

179
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:12,310
So basically, uh, You will try to
avoid, uh, manual data transfer at all

180
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,670
costs, whenever you can, because, uh,
eat when you have lots of, uh, lots

181
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,620
of information that you need to enter
that can lead to serious issues, errors

182
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:28,500
and of course, you're going to spend
lots of time, uh, or, uh, pay lots of

183
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,630
money, uh, hiring employees, that will
that will manage, uh, the post of, uh,

184
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,130
data entry or, uh, uh, data transfer,
uh, which obviously is not, uh, which

185
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,410
is, uh, basically you to the business
post is that is not the most efficient.

186
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,589
That is, uh, pretty much the
time that you don't do not have.

187
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,055
Uh, let's talk about, uh, the first
case of we've mentioned, uh, how does

188
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:05,084
it affect a specific, uh, business?

189
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:13,635
Uh, how can we, uh, how can we
basically, uh, how can we, uh, see

190
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:19,665
how, uh, how can we see that, uh,
that things in, uh, in the world.

191
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:28,215
He's a real life example, uh, of how that,
uh, that can affect the business meet.

192
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,165
Um, yeah.

193
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:31,065
Uh, okay.

194
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:33,375
Meet Mary she's, the website coordinator.

195
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:39,165
And, uh, as you can see, many
is, uh, working in a furniture.

196
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,305
These are competent.

197
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:44,895
Uh, of course, you know, if you're
working with furniture, you have

198
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:49,380
lots of, uh, You need to be a quota.

199
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:53,699
Uh, you need to, uh, kept connections
with the market to adjust to

200
00:14:53,699 --> 00:15:00,240
changes in prices shipping, uh,
in suppliers, uh, it's attracting

201
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,850
those is I actually can work for a
furniture, uh, uh, uh, sales company.

202
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,079
So basically.

203
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,870
Explains that, that myself
and the, this situation,

204
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,960
obviously Mary is somebody else.

205
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:20,780
However, I, I had to, I got to experience
this situation in, uh, in real life.

206
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,710
Uh, okay.

207
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,730
So, uh, here's the problem, her company.

208
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,720
Uh, has just found a supplier that
has a cheaper prices and the, of

209
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,510
course, that is going to make them, uh,
competitive, uh, on the market even more.

210
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,410
Uh, they, they, they need
to change their supplier.

211
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,620
And, uh, so, uh, and as, as a direct
consequence of changing supplier, they

212
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,250
also need to adjust their prices and.

213
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,864
If, you know, uh,
adjusted prices, uh, okay.

214
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:01,645
No big deal.

215
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,594
I can adjust 10 products.

216
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,905
Uh, I don't need automation.

217
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,645
I can type typing myself.

218
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:14,280
Uh, any changes that they have, uh,
There is not going to be, uh, th there's

219
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,280
not going to be, uh, any, any like
specific, uh, specific issues with that.

220
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,569
And I don't need to really
automate the task if I can, uh,

221
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,849
do it basically in 15 minutes.

222
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,390
However, uh, when you're running, uh,
lots of products and you have lots

223
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,369
of variations for those products,
essentially, uh, WooCommerce treats

224
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:42,855
those variations and separate
products, uh, not entirely.

225
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:46,185
But, uh, if you have like, uh,

226
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,395
I'm going to make an example.

227
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:53,685
If you have chairs that from, uh,
different types of food, obviously the

228
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,605
pricing is not going to be the same.

229
00:16:56,025 --> 00:17:01,455
And, uh, each of those variations have its
own prices uh, that needs to be addressed.

230
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:08,974
And the once Mary, uh, calculated
how much time will it take to,

231
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,925
uh, implement those changes.

232
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:15,724
She found out that, uh, she's going
to need at least eight days since,

233
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:21,454
uh, uh, can stalk has a total of 500
products that need to be adjusted.

234
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:25,615
If you can multiply that
with variations or let's say.

235
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,890
Uh, a channel that has five
different types of three.

236
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:38,870
Uh, let's say, uh, we are shipping this,
uh, in, uh, two different sizes and,

237
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,800
uh, also in like five different cars.

238
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:51,110
So, uh, five times, five times two
equals 50, actually for that prompt

239
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,330
product of chair  she needs, uh, to, uh,
Make changes to 50 profits essentially.

240
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,000
And that, that could be really,
really time consuming and also

241
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,230
extremely boring if you have ever
about, uh, this, uh, business.

242
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:14,610
Uh, web coordinators are very important
in making sure that those tasks are,

243
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,310
are handled properly and, uh, it is.

244
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,710
For WooCommerce developers.

245
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:27,179
Uh, one of, uh, key jobs is to secure
that they're doing their, uh, their pro

246
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:33,389
uh, their process of data entry and, uh,
making sure that the story is flexible

247
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:41,010
enough to make changes is one of the key
factors of, uh, Uh, basically making sure

248
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:47,430
that, uh, they're not gonna get, uh, not
gonna have any delays or, uh, issues, uh,

249
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,760
that can, that can pop up in the process.

250
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,540
The big question we need to answer
is how can she get the job done fast?

251
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,580
Eight days is a lot, uh, five
content products is a lot.

252
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,249
If she had like, uh, fivehundred chairs.

253
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:12,185
Obviously that's going to
be, uh, an overkill, but

254
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,915
that is, uh, 55,000 products.

255
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:18,935
And obviously that is not humanely
possible even for the eight days,

256
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,425
uh, that, uh, she calculated.

257
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:27,185
Uh, however, there are some things
that, uh, we can do here to, uh,

258
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:32,375
ensure that Mary's going to have,
uh, her, uh, process improved.

259
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,705
And one of the things.

260
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,590
Uh, could help her out our bulk edits.

261
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,960
Uh, for bulk editing.

262
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,870
Uh, you can have lots of tools available.

263
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,480
I have only mentioned some of those tools.

264
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:57,100
So th there is, uh, I think 10 or 15
varied, uh, w WooCommerce, bargains, or

265
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,560
other the way to do, uh, WordPress plugin
that allow you to, to bulk edit products.

266
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,320
Uh, basically what that means instead of.

267
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:11,895
Opening each product when you need to edit
it, uh, at the opening each variation,

268
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:19,335
when you need to make edits, you can, uh,
basically, uh, open multiple products and,

269
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:24,345
uh, edit them, uh, uh, at the same time.

270
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:29,715
And once you save, save changes or the
changes in pricing for instance will

271
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,535
be saved uh, to all of those products.

272
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:38,625
So this is one of the, uh, Cubase
you can, uh, use to basically

273
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,535
improve, uh, to improve these poses.

274
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:47,135
Uh, there is, uh, one another way.

275
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:52,425
Uh, if you have lots of products and
for instance, uh, supplier sentence,

276
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:59,775
uh, Excel sheet, you can export to
the Excel sheet in a CSV file, or you

277
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:07,905
can uh get the next smell file at, uh,
uh, also, uh, export, uh, data in, uh,

278
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:14,264
in this, uh, form and, uh, input this
data, basically you would replace your

279
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:21,885
products, uh, one-on-one uh, using, uh,
using the data, uh, this like, uh, this

280
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,135
post is scan, uh, see what's of time.

281
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:29,354
If you have, uh, if you have a, like
a story that has, uh, more than, uh,

282
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:33,435
It comes with products, 1000 products.

283
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:38,505
However, it does come with a, with
some downsides because, uh, there are

284
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:44,235
limitations as to which data you can
export and how you can import them,

285
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,115
especially when it comes to CSV.

286
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:52,825
Uh, Handling images just can sometimes
be an issue and, uh, they're the plenty

287
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:58,365
of factors, uh, that, uh, that can go
wrong with, uh, with, uh, importing

288
00:21:58,545 --> 00:22:05,430
this, uh, This, uh, uh, amount of
products, however, even the, even the

289
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:12,480
wheat, uh, with those side effects, uh,
if you able to import crucial data like

290
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:22,200
pricing or, uh, or changes in, uh, but
changes, uh, in, uh, shipping or, uh,

291
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,390
cars, if you have like products that have
different that attributes as well, then.

292
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,540
That can definitely save you lots of time.

293
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,939
And, uh, if anything goes wrong, you
can, uh, basically, and enter those,

294
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:43,050
uh, the missing information, uh, once
you verified that, uh, everything that

295
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,540
could be, uh, imported can be actually,
uh, is actually imported properly.

296
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:56,040
Some of the tools you can use, uh,
for, uh, For this, uh, uh, basically,

297
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,570
uh, yeah, that, that is actually
really important for common scan, uh,

298
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,240
can, uh, make those changes directly.

299
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,420
Uh, you, you also have, uh, uh, basically
you have, uh, the default template

300
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:16,560
system, which can be used to input
WooCommerce products, uh, and, uh, you

301
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:24,345
would, uh, and then you're presented
with, uh, with, uh, With the system

302
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:29,264
that to allow you to map fields and to
connect everything that can be connected,

303
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:34,845
like dicing the names of products,
descriptions, all of the, all the stuff

304
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:39,555
that would take lots time to enter,
especially if you're starting a new.

305
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:41,865
VPO in parties.

306
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,095
I go level up to that.

307
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:48,105
So, uh, about a couple of
products is very similar.

308
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:52,935
However, uh, there, there are also
many tools that, that you can use,

309
00:23:52,965 --> 00:24:01,215
uh, to, uh, to basically complete,
uh, complete this task and just drop

310
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:05,145
all the products that you can then
replace them with new products from a,

311
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,965
uh, from a new vendor, for instance.

312
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,050
And also there is a, another cool
feature, uh, that, that you can use.

313
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:22,590
And, uh, that is to actually sync
products, uh, from a third party.

314
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:30,240
Uh, for instance, if you're your supplier
is using, uh, Using some third party,

315
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:36,000
uh, third party technology, uh, for
listing those products and the ha has it

316
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,030
available for, uh, everyone, uh, uh, that
that's, uh, completing, uh, a big, uh,

317
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,699
that is actually working in B2C market.

318
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,080
Then, uh, then, uh, syncing
products, they actually, from that

319
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,300
drink will definitely help you out.

320
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,960
And, uh, There are lots of different
technologies that can, that you can use.

321
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,910
Uh, actually I'm going just to mention
a WooCommerce CPI product thing,

322
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:13,930
because, uh, it can be useful even
for, uh, the, the smallest, uh, stores.

323
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,810
And I'm going to give you a use case.

324
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,220
You have like a one store that
sells furniture in, for instance,

325
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,330
Dallas, uh, another store that
sells furniture in Houston.

326
00:25:25,845 --> 00:25:28,185
Third store that sells furniture in LA.

327
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:35,564
And, uh, basically all stores look the
same, but, uh, they, uh, and, and the

328
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:39,945
show different products from one stock,
however, they have a different pricing,

329
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:45,405
different marketing, and, uh, basically,
uh, their, their branding is different.

330
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:52,200
Uh, if you need to, uh, if you need
to, uh, Update changes, uh, uh, or

331
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,360
the one store you need to do that
also for the others, unless you have

332
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:04,020
a way to actually propagate those
changes directly on our stores.

333
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,960
And these two can really help you
out, uh, automate IO and some things,

334
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,090
more advanced technology center have
a in integration systems to basically

335
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:18,030
connect you to a third party services?

336
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:25,649
Uh, I think their, uh, their, uh,
integration library, uh, is, uh, filling

337
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:32,790
them with lots of, uh, basically the,
the integration library, uh, is expanding

338
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:39,780
every day and some of them even have
the, the ability to, uh, expand the.

339
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:46,185
Uh, to basically allow developers to, to
add their own libraries for integration

340
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:50,175
with which can be really cool and, uh,
can, uh, can save you lots of time.

341
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:58,784
Essentially this so eliminate the post-its
of, uh, of, uh, basically, uh, trying to

342
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:05,595
find the different ways of export to give,
just connect to the two technologies and

343
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:07,814
you don't have to write custom apps to.

344
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,410
Uh, basically to connect,
uh, to connect those two.

345
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,600
And, uh, if you say, uh, if for
instance, supplier changes, prices.

346
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:24,370
Your, uh, your product pricing
can also change that day.

347
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,979
You can make a, for instance,
if you're, obviously you want

348
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,149
to learn something from that.

349
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,550
So, uh, if you want to, uh,
amplify the price, uh, that, uh,

350
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,560
you can do that automatically.

351
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,290
So basically you have a
mathematic formula, the, to, uh,

352
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,580
do the heavy lifting for you.

353
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,165
Now let's talk about the second issue.

354
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:53,525
And, uh, that is, uh, the fact that issues
can be really tricky to, uh, to detect.

355
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:55,715
Here we have Dan.

356
00:27:56,655 --> 00:28:02,105
Dan owns a WooCommerce store and, uh,
he sells, uh, office equipment and,

357
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,995
uh, things are generally going well.

358
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,105
He's not complaining.

359
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:10,115
He's a very happy how the things
that are going however, after one

360
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:18,120
year of business, Customer calls and,
uh, uh, his customer says that, uh,

361
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,820
she cannot, uh, add product to cart.

362
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,940
If you had experienced the issue, uh, for
instance, then you add to cart and then

363
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,070
go to the cart page and cart is empty.

364
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,780
Then you know, that it can be really
annoying and, uh, uh, can definitely

365
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,210
dive state the sales of from a website.

366
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,455
Uh, When she speaks with customers
to find out how is it possible?

367
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:47,135
He finds out that the customer is
using Firefox as their main browser.

368
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:55,155
Uh, and, uh, obviously, uh, Mo uh, most of
Dan's customers, uh, used Google Chrome.

369
00:28:55,235 --> 00:29:00,245
So he was unaware of the issue
until a customer reported it.

370
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,595
He paid the developer to fix the issue.

371
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:10,335
And once he did that, the
sales just went up by 15%.

372
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:15,315
Uh, however, obviously one year is passed.

373
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:21,765
Uh, so we lost 15% of,
uh, income for one year.

374
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:26,565
Obviously that's not a simple math,
however, uh, we can definitely see how

375
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:33,555
a simple issue, uh, basically, uh, a
stupid issue affected the business grade.

376
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:41,625
Uh, Is there any way we could help
Dan  , uh, prevent this situation?

377
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:44,805
What could help Dan spot the issue sooner?

378
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:51,135
And the answer to that question
is basically do whatever you can.

379
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:52,785
However, don't rely that.

380
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:56,775
That a specific technology will tell
you everything you need to know.

381
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:03,285
So if you do not receive animals, so
if you do not, uh, see any, uh, major

382
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:09,525
changes, uh, do not see any major
changes, uh, to, uh, for instance,

383
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:14,925
Google analytics results, uh, then,
uh, you might still have an issue.

384
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:23,365
One of the, the, uh, apps that the top,
the most efficient of, uh, for using,

385
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:29,605
uh, for improving the overall process
is customer behavior monitoring apps.

386
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:38,745
Uh, those apps are, uh, are mainly,
uh, Like a specific dashboard in

387
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:43,274
which you're going to enter and see
all your, uh, customers interactions,

388
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:44,955
whether it is a quick stream.

389
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:52,125
Some of those bathrooms also have a
recording features so that you can, uh,

390
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:57,895
see, uh, what, what customer was seeing at
the, basically it can help you replicate

391
00:30:57,915 --> 00:31:07,879
the error that a customer got, uh,
Basically when we are working on, uh, when

392
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:12,830
we are working on a WooCommerce stores and
whenever we are carrying the product, we

393
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:19,610
are, uh, that, that we use, uh, regularly,
we are trying to put, uh, put ourselves

394
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:27,200
in the equation and think of a customer
as how would I purchase something and.

395
00:31:28,524 --> 00:31:33,865
Sometimes sometimes that, uh, does create,
uh, that, that can create lots of issues.

396
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:39,834
Uh, and, uh, we cannot, uh, replicate
the purchase process of somebody else.

397
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:44,365
For instance, uh, we might
be using a trackpad somebody

398
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:45,834
else might be using a mouse.

399
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:52,135
Uh, we might, uh, be for instance, a
solo in cooking things while we have some

400
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:58,169
customers that very fast to complete,
but it just builds this, uh, To complete

401
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:03,540
purchase process is faster and, uh,
they're used to quick, faster than us.

402
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:10,320
Uh, they can easily expose issues at
break our websites, uh, does a lot

403
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,030
actually break the websites, but, uh,
they can the PC virus because they

404
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:21,510
are about using the, our WooCommerce,
uh, application the way it is intended

405
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,060
or the way it is, uh, designed.

406
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,780
However, obviously
customer is always right.

407
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,650
So you need to make sure that you
can handle those, uh, those, uh,

408
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,290
situations and, uh, be prepared
that, uh, your store can work even

409
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,990
in the, this, uh, in this situation.

410
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:49,850
Another way to, uh, easily spot some
errors is RD error reporting plugins.

411
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:55,320
Uh, some of the most common error
reporting plugins as he'd be all,

412
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,020
however, you all slowed that, uh, work.

413
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:04,469
This also has a, uh, reporting that,
uh, obviously can be, uh, can be very

414
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:09,419
effective if you have, uh, issue that
CA that actually built the website.

415
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:16,050
However, tracking time, if a
EOC get the Iris notices that.

416
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:22,665
Something is wrong or that something
is getting deprecated can lead

417
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:28,155
you to additional information, uh,
that can, uh, that can basically

418
00:33:28,335 --> 00:33:33,840
prevent the issue, uh, before it
happens or, uh, if an issue happens.

419
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:40,320
You will be the first to know, uh, you
can have, uh, you can have the, uh, L

420
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,850
sock that reported in your dashboard,
or you can receive emails that are

421
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:52,390
going to, uh, if, if, uh, something
went wrong or some of the crucial

422
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,510
steps, uh, the purchase process.

423
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:03,979
Also, uh, another cool feature, uh,
another cool tool that you can use,

424
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,120
uh, uptime monitor platforms, uh,
those plugins you probably use the

425
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:12,049
already, uh, there are lots of them.

426
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:19,759
Uh, Jetpack also has, uh, also has, uh,
uptime monitoring system integrated.

427
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:24,880
However, uh, I also used
the, I also listed the.

428
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:30,870
These, these three platforms that, uh, I
personally had good experience with you,

429
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,210
you may, you might use something else.

430
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,330
Uh, however, when you have, uh, goes
down at the, I'm not going to say if

431
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:45,630
your website goes down because you know,
uh, that, uh, eventually it is going to

432
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:51,690
happen, but the question is how, or get
the, uh, how, how well are you prepared

433
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,430
to handle the issue and fix these.

434
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,970
Uh, either the case or you need to be
prepared to, uh, make sure that, uh,

435
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,370
issues popped at the instantly and
that, uh, you're not going to lose sales

436
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:14,760
because of, uh, uh, because of the issue,
uh, here we have, uh, lead management

437
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,755
difficulties and, uh, We are going
to meet with, uh, I forgot her name.

438
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:23,715
Oh, mic.

439
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:24,165
Yeah.

440
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:30,525
Maggie's a sales manager of a WooCommerce
store that sells office equipment.

441
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:38,335
Uh, oh, sorry guys, yeah, she, uh, and.

442
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,625
Basically an embarrassing thing happened.

443
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:47,024
Uh, she, uh, she did make real
checks though, but she noticed

444
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,814
that a checkout is broken.

445
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,834
Something is wrong.

446
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:52,484
She cannot checkout.

447
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:55,665
She cannot, uh, for instance,
get access to PayPal.

448
00:35:56,084 --> 00:36:03,825
And, uh, uh, basically, uh, she knows
that, uh, whenever you have a, uh,

449
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:06,254
issue of this kind you're losing sales.

450
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:08,955
And she reacted instantly.

451
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:15,975
I, the developer who fixed the
issue, but, uh, uh, she, uh, noticed

452
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:22,925
that, uh, 15 sales have been lost,
uh, because 15 customers saw that

453
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:26,625
he reached to the checkout pages,
according to analytics, and they did

454
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,925
not complete the checkout process.

455
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:34,155
Now the question we have is.

456
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:39,615
Was there any way to minimize the
damage from the worst sales and, uh,

457
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:45,105
there, uh, quite a lot of tools that
are very simple to use don't require

458
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:50,565
any significant, uh, investments, but,
uh, can definitely save you, uh, or

459
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:52,215
lots of money if you implement them.

460
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:52,755
Correct.

461
00:36:54,555 --> 00:37:01,035
First of all, If you have a WooCommerce
store that sells products, uh, then you

462
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:03,255
also need to have the abandoned cart.

463
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:11,235
Uh, basically, uh, abandoned cart system,
uh, is, uh, application basically accepts

464
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:16,065
that is going to capture information that
design to the checkout page, uh, before

465
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,195
the purchase is, uh, has completely.

466
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:24,285
Uh, if, uh, for instance, that can
capture notably if you have an issue, but

467
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:29,685
also in the situations where customers,
where there are two, uh, two's your

468
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:34,484
public and that they change their
mind, the public somewhere else, or

469
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:39,075
you can invite them shake, uh, yo you,
you still have a product to your cart.

470
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:42,544
Uh, and, uh, working,

471
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,654
look, utilize this technology.

472
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,200
Uh, we.

473
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:55,725
Which is very sad because,
uh, the implementation of this

474
00:37:55,725 --> 00:38:00,705
technology, uh, basically costs
installing, uh, overcast park.

475
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:05,625
Here are some plugins that you can use
there are lots of plugins that the, uh,

476
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:08,085
made we used, uh, for abandoned cart.

477
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,230
Uh, let's, let's say like this, uh,
this technology is not foolproof.

478
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,420
You still need to have email address
to which, uh, customers will, uh, be

479
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,470
doing to complete the checkout process.

480
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,280
However, if you can arrange your fields
correctly, then you can capture, uh,

481
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,340
capture to the purchase information that
is needed, like, uh, email addresses

482
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:37,395
or, uh, Th this new information
that is, uh, that can be used to

483
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,435
recover basically those lost sales.

484
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:47,685
Another, uh, way to spot tissues would
be using a CRM system or, or a similar

485
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:51,105
solution, uh, for lead management here.

486
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:57,660
Some of the popular CRM systems at, uh,
I just thought to say those apps a lot

487
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,580
strictly CRM systems, because they have
up of additional integration tools.

488
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:10,650
Uh, however, what I noticed the
most, uh, is that, uh, having a chat

489
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,460
integration is very important, uh, to.

490
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:20,295
To basically collect information, uh,
from customers, uh, and to reach out to

491
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:29,865
them in case of, uh, in case of issues,
uh, therefore, uh, heavy, heavy, the CRM

492
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:32,295
that collects that, uh, that information.

493
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:40,275
is the key to, uh, notice
if there are any problems.

494
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:44,955
And if customer did not have all
the old information, you might have

495
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,805
said, customer, they're just going
to be a web city area and that you

496
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:52,395
can, the, uh, they actually, uh,
correct this information to customer.

497
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:58,355
Uh, they talked to him to see if,
uh, uh, to him, for instance, that

498
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:02,045
the, she is fixing the, that, uh,
he can complete the checkout posts.

499
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:09,695
Also, uh, you make, have noticed that,
uh, uh, abandoned cart is, uh, uh,

500
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:17,045
Michael, uh, system for, uh, basically
a bad guy is also my microsystem for,

501
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:24,390
uh, with the generation, uh, However,
uh, you will, you will sometimes

502
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,190
need to integrate both of them.

503
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,660
So basically both the bad guy in CRM
and the, there are some small events

504
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,370
solutions that you can use here is
called probably some that, uh, I

505
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,200
have personally used Rico forever.

506
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:42,270
Uh, those two solutions I've heard
very, uh, HubSpot, that guide stack.

507
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,770
I've heard the odds of.

508
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:52,319
What's useful information, uh, that can
basically help you out and, uh, and,

509
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:59,549
uh, allow you to manage your reads more
easily at the Cabo deformations about

510
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,490
their bad guides, about, uh, the, uh,
purchase bills that has not been completed

511
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,710
and to know how to handle that properly.

512
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:13,545
Finally, we go to a
manual date to translate.

513
00:41:13,575 --> 00:41:16,845
And for this case, we're
going to meet Gary.

514
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:24,015
Gary has a very successful, uh, online
bookstore and the business is going

515
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:29,055
well, actually, so well that it, that,
uh, it actually is not going well

516
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:32,115
because, uh, he has two Bob's customers.

517
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,545
Uh, two books are sold.

518
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:41,415
Uh he's uh, His staff is unable to add
to all the changes and the days lots

519
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,695
of fill station at the KP workers.

520
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:48,855
Uh, they're, they're leaving their space
because of the stress and, uh, that, uh,

521
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:56,085
obviously, uh, although he he's, uh, he's
always selling, uh, his, uh, his books.

522
00:41:56,145 --> 00:42:01,155
Uh, he, he's not happy because he's losing
valuable customers that, that can the

523
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:04,215
w w he's using valuable staff at the.

524
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,065
And the debt can easily cure business.

525
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:10,095
Uh, even though it is successful though.

526
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:15,345
And, uh, obviously when you have
a lots of manual work, mistakes

527
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:21,194
captured in his case, uh, he sold more
books than he has in stock because,

528
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:25,935
uh, somebody basically had a back
study to add that case to the best.

529
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:27,975
How can we rectify the.

530
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:35,895
How can we, uh, actually, uh, prevent
those mistakes and, uh, uh, overall,

531
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:38,325
uh, how, how else we can save time?

532
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:42,035
There are a couple of ways I'm not
going to say that these ways are

533
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:46,635
exclusive or, uh, that, uh, there
are a lot better ways to do that.

534
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:51,345
Uh, you have a lots of cool
technologies that you can explore.

535
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:56,444
Uh, first source and the,
the cheapest deepest of the

536
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:58,305
Mo is to just to emit stock.

537
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:05,055
There are lots of pockets that you can
use to, to weed stock, uh, and those that

538
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,065
can be done for WooCommerce directly.

539
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:15,705
Uh, therefore, uh, I would say if you
D if you have lots of stores, then the.

540
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:21,585
Then you will need more, more events
to solution, uh, that the emitting

541
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:27,645
stock, therefore you need to, you need
to see, uh, what works the best for

542
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:30,585
your business and twos to the topic.

543
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:36,605
So should, uh, other way to
basically remediate the process of.

544
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:41,555
A manual data entry would
be automatic updates.

545
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:47,315
Uh, I don't that many, many
companies still use Google

546
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:49,175
sheets for managing stock.

547
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:54,935
Uh, at the via Google sheets is very,
very useful as technology, uh, can be

548
00:43:54,935 --> 00:44:01,484
expanded, uh, basically, uh, As much
as it is evolved using Google script,

549
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:06,044
which is a technology that you can use
to write a script that they're going

550
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:10,785
to, uh, affect, uh, the , uh, table.

551
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:13,274
Uh, it is not the most efficient way.

552
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:17,964
And, uh, if you have all the folders
that that's going to quickly pile up and

553
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:20,444
become a sole table, that's going to cash.

554
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:21,774
I know this from.

555
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:29,055
Uh, if you can automate the process of
entering golden standard, you can, the,

556
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:36,405
for instance, if you're already using,
uh, uh, ex uh, exosuits, import them to

557
00:44:36,435 --> 00:44:41,325
Google sheets and, uh, you can connect
that directly to have a cover story.

558
00:44:41,385 --> 00:44:44,835
And the once you make change there,
the page is going to propagate.

559
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:50,735
They actually are used for
another, uh, another system that.

560
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:56,595
Probably, uh, needs to be spoken
more than, than it already is,

561
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:58,425
is a stock management system.

562
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:02,745
Especially if you have multiple
stores, uh, there are lots of,

563
00:45:02,835 --> 00:45:04,755
uh, stock beds with systems.

564
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:07,215
Some of them are completely feed.

565
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:08,295
Some of them are paid.

566
00:45:08,985 --> 00:45:14,865
Uh, my personal advice regarding that is
five to what best works for your business.

567
00:45:14,865 --> 00:45:16,785
Start small and then go big.

568
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,900
Now he agreed to talk
about advanced automation.

569
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,660
Uh, and yes, this is where
developers come into play.

570
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,930
Uh, colleagues will probably
staple to be, uh, be customized,

571
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:36,360
uh, using different technologies.

572
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,950
Well, recovers is a very, very
flexible in that guide has multiple

573
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,590
fixed features, uh, that can be used.

574
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:50,115
We'll call the subject is, uh, One of
the easy methods to collect the data.

575
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:54,165
If you're there, they actually, from a
working from a workplace environment.

576
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:59,265
And for instance, you have a custom
parking that you need to, uh, for

577
00:45:59,265 --> 00:46:00,795
which you need to pull the data.

578
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:04,095
Uh, we'll cover a subject
is very useful, uh, as.

579
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,660
W, uh, as long as you have a WooCommerce
pocket active, that you can pull the

580
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,460
data that is stored in the object.

581
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,529
A rest API is, uh, probably underused in
the circumstances, but it is, uh, one of

582
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,660
the fastest ways, ways to pull data from.

583
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,090
Uh, what the swept state, uh, if you
have a rest API connection, then you

584
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:32,380
can make us API requests to, to pull
the data that is, uh, that is needed.

585
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:37,590
So, so to these data, uh, any way
you want, uh, using, uh, the cusp

586
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:42,840
of technology, are you using at
the, you you're basically, uh,

587
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,860
you basically see the limits in
the, in terms of, uh, technology.

588
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,420
So Gabby going with you, see you.

589
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:57,870
Uh, you also can, uh, manage your,
uh, your tasks using, uh, uh, WP, uh,

590
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:05,180
CRI, which is a, basically a shared
application, which allows you to put

591
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,570
the, if you use the T you know, what
I'm talking about, but it's a shallow

592
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:17,040
application used to, uh, to automate
some of the tasks and basically to, uh,

593
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:24,069
Uh, make to, to work with them as if
you're a Linux system administrator.

594
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:33,069
So if you like command lines that the
school, uh, also, uh, jobs and web

595
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:37,299
hooks are useful com jobs, because
if you can schedule tasks, you can,

596
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,410
uh, you can, uh, write the contract
that is going to complete that task,

597
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,709
uh, at specific periods of time.

598
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,730
Web hooks are made useful.

599
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:52,260
If you need to pull data from another
technology, do you need the, basically a

600
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,510
point for which you can, you can do that.

601
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:01,380
If you're, if you're a specific third
party providers, it has the ability

602
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,900
to, to pull data for vocables that you
may, uh, you may need to use that for.

603
00:48:09,134 --> 00:48:16,365
Uh, other than, uh, the technologist that
they most used, uh, they're also dedicated

604
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:18,825
to covering cyber is a beta on the

605
00:48:21,854 --> 00:48:24,915
to the official, correct me if
I'm wrong, but, uh, there are

606
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:26,625
also many more libraries that.

607
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:33,919
Community, uh, basically councils to
libraries, uh, created by community,

608
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,990
uh, that can also be implemented.

609
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:43,339
And also as a developer, I always have
to, uh, but if you can, uh, resources

610
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:48,470
to do that, that if you have, uh,
ways to do that, always create the

611
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,379
custom source called customized.

612
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,089
The customer is the source of that is
going to be best suited for your business.

613
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:06,960
Uh, and, uh, and, uh, probably the,
the, the fastest way to, to pull data

614
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,330
would be to use the custom source,
uh, that, that you can, the, that you

615
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,840
can modify per your personal needs,
especially if those needs change.

616
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:22,785
And if you're using a custom solution,
actually not only custom source with the

617
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:28,424
30 other solution, mind security and the
data protection, uh, because sometimes,

618
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:34,605
uh, when you, you need, uh, I'm, I'm
actually encouraging you to, to check

619
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:39,884
your, uh, local legislation to see if
any of the technologies you're using some

620
00:49:39,884 --> 00:49:41,895
colleagues, iwi go in your countries.

621
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:48,495
In most cases, it's five because the car
is wide spread, especially the webs that

622
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:51,045
the, uh, that the publicly available.

623
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:56,685
However, we go advice is a absolute,
absolute must in this case.

624
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:04,315
And, uh, I just thought to image about
the basics, make sure that you keep your

625
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:07,305
workers' comp up to date pockets teams.

626
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:14,400
And, uh, and so that your story is
protected, that, uh, that is secure,

627
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:20,730
uh, most of Marvel infections that get
the debit, your website are, uh, of

628
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,430
course by a cop that is out of date.

629
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,020
I only to overuse the WooCommerce
pockets that can pile up at that,

630
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:37,455
uh, that can, uh, Kate performance
issues also make sure that you . Yeah.

631
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:40,005
Uh, not getting tripped
on your hosting server.

632
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:45,825
Find the server that is going to, uh,
be able to support all the old you have,

633
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:52,095
uh, all the world, uh, that, uh, your
customers may, uh, make the eight on it.

634
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:57,915
Optimize your e-commerce store, uh, use,
uh, tools like geomatics or Google page

635
00:50:57,945 --> 00:50:59,765
page to find the ways to optimize your.

636
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:05,145
As I already mentioned, the legislation
needs to be top of your mind.

637
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:08,774
There are some pockets that can also
help you with that as you can see,

638
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:15,734
but, uh, I do still advise you to,
uh, talk to, uh, your legal advisor at

639
00:51:15,734 --> 00:51:21,315
the, see if you're in compliance that
you have the local, uh, regulations.

640
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:27,404
And the most important thing, uh, as
somebody who works in the tech supported

641
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:32,865
to see, I can say that scheduled
backups save lives trust me on my word.

642
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:35,745
Michelle Frechette: At
least they save websites.

643
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:36,145
Right?

644
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,095
Dan Maby: Absolutely.

645
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:44,385
And I'm afraid we were going to,
unfortunately, to wrap up, we

646
00:51:44,385 --> 00:51:46,335
are rapidly running out of time.

647
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:50,565
Um, did you have a quick two
minutes summary before you, uh,

648
00:51:50,595 --> 00:51:51,995
before we take off your slides.

649
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:52,930
Andrija Radojev: Yeah.

650
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:53,270
Yeah.

651
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,810
Uh, actually that is my last slide.

652
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,990
So a lot of our key takeaways, I'm
going to split it up basically.

653
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,430
We're faster time to, uh, try to
find ways to improve the business

654
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:08,549
process, uh, automate crucial tasks.

655
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:08,970
Correct.

656
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:11,160
Quite though deformation, you need to.

657
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:17,404
Uh, adaptive, uh, social style
preferences, and obviously the resources,

658
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:25,215
the budget you have start small, uh, that
the go big, uh, and, uh, obviously, uh,

659
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:31,695
issues and ensure you're is up to date.

660
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:38,775
My, my final advice is, uh, always
try to think for the future.

661
00:52:39,165 --> 00:52:40,875
And you're going to thank yourself for.

662
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:44,655
Dan Maby: A great piece
of advice to end on there.

and obviously a lot that

666
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:51,225
can be covered across this.
