Cathy Tibbles: Welcome back.

33
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,360
Next we welcome Karen Tompkins with
move on, dealing with anxiety and anger.

34
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,220
When Karen's first child was born,
she stopped breathing due to a

35
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,990
rare disorder, affecting her brain.

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,520
It became Karen's and mission to learn
all things neuroscience in order to help

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
her daughter reach her full potential.

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,155
Drawing on her 30 plus years experience
as a teacher, administrator and

39
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:29,325
curriculum developer, she then taught
thousands of students, educators, and

40
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:34,515
parents, to understand the power of
their narrow chemistry and how it drives

41
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,845
behaviors due to anxiety and anger.

42
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,985
She shares simple but effective
techniques to trick your brain to move

43
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,835
on past these intrusive behaviors.

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Karan Tompkins: Hello.

45
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,329
I'm glad you're here.

46
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,310
And, uh, without further
ado, I am Karen Tompkins.

47
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,070
I'm just going to get my slide deck
rolling and we'll get started and

48
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,709
we have a good 45 minutes together.

49
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,465
Uh, the last five we will try
and, uh, reserver for Q and A.

50
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:11,575
All right.

51
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,955
So, um, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank the

52
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,325
organizers for having me here today.

53
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:24,715
I'm honored to be able to share my
experiences with you and thankful.

54
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,455
Yeah, just kidding.

55
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:30,055
It's so not going to be like that at all.

56
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,635
Now I can't see or hear any of you.

57
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:37,105
So I'm just going to assume that you are
laughing because I thought it was funny.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,840
Some of you just in those 20 seconds may
have thought I need to get out of here.

59
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,060
Or this is crazy.

60
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm not staying here for this.

61
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:56,740
Um, or you just felt really uncomfortable
and that's an anxiety, anger response.

62
00:04:57,915 --> 00:05:02,235
When the fright flight fight response
kicks in because their stress

63
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:06,405
that suddenly you have to take
care of and it happens like that.

64
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,605
So that's what we're going to talk
about today is how that happens.

65
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:14,955
Um, and then a few things that
we can do to offset those.

66
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,085
Things that happen to you.

67
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:23,535
So at this point, it's important that
we identify our baseline behaviors.

68
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:30,165
And what I mean by that is what
is it that you do or your body

69
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:35,955
does, um, and when this happens,
you know, I'm really stressed.

70
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,275
I am on the edge.

71
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:41,595
For example, for me, I eat a lot
of cookies, so, you know, I kind of

72
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,775
get through a half a bag of cookies
and I go, yep it's a bad day.

73
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:50,175
Um, maybe you chew your fingernails,
you snap at your partner

74
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,085
or, um, you have indigenous.

75
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,650
Issues, irritable bowel
syndrome, things like that.

76
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,310
Uh, we'll learn later in, in our time
together that your gut is directly

77
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,240
attached to the neurochemistry
that drives your behavior in

78
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,220
an anxiety, anger response.

79
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,870
So we're going to talk about that.

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,800
So think about the one or two things
that happen for you and you know,

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,450
that, that means that you're stressed.

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
And I'd like you to
actually jot that down.

83
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,310
If you have something to write
on or, you know, memo in your

84
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,110
phone or something like that.

85
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,510
Uh, because we're going to come back
to that in about 40 minutes time.

86
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,219
And indeed, I'd like you to take a
look at it again in about three months.

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,849
Okay.

88
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,039
So writing it down would
be very helpful for them.

89
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:43,125
All right.

90
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:49,965
So, um, I am a speaker cause I'm
speaking an author, I'm an educator.

91
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:55,065
Um, if you want to know more
about my credentials and why I

92
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:57,585
think I maybe know something.

93
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:00,705
Hop over to my website.

94
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,925
ktomkins.com and there's a lot there.

95
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,534
You can email me if
you have any questions.

96
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:09,224
I have two books, one
is called purple stew.

97
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,335
It's out of print.

98
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:16,245
So it is now a free download at
lulu.com and that's the story of

99
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:23,140
my journey to a diagnosis of a rare
disorder for my oldest daughter, Erin.

100
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,530
And it's because of that journey that
I have studied and found these answers

101
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,750
that I'm sharing with you today.

102
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,720
I have another children's book,
different is just different.

103
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,480
It has lesson plans and stuff
that's available on my website.

104
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,620
That's Aaron.

105
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,460
Okay.

106
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,980
So Aaron is now 28 years old.

107
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,840
And when she was born,
she stopped breathing.

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,159
Which you know is a problem.

109
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:53,590
And so they've ran all kinds of
tests and couldn't figure out

110
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,510
why she kept stopping breathing.

111
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,250
Now they didn't have to open an airway.

112
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,940
We just kind of physically stimulated
her and she'd start breathing again.

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,690
But, um, The breathing was
definitely not rhythmic.

114
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:11,630
So this is Aaron at a few years
old with her little sister, Sarah,

115
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,359
Sarah is only a year and three weeks
younger and that was by design.

116
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:26,965
Uh, so Sarah is now 27 and she has a
degree in neuroscience and biology.

117
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:30,265
So we really like to talk about brains.

118
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:37,135
Um, and, um, she's actually
at the FAC ed, um, doing a

119
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,635
master's in education right now.

120
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:42,265
So we have a lot to talk about, anyway,
this is Aaron a couple of years ago

121
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:47,590
and, uh, she doesn't stop breathing
anymore, which is really good.

122
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,570
We found out when she was about
three and a half, that the reason

123
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,500
for that Rocky start was that she has
something called you bear syndrome.

124
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,140
And that's a very rare disorder.

125
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,460
We know of about 2000 people in the
world that have to bear syndrome and

126
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,900
it affects the part of the brain that
regulates breathing and motoric things

127
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,295
and really anything sensory, um, And,
uh, w well, we've also discovered that

128
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:19,785
for you science guys or people it's a
celiac disease, so there are actually four

129
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:23,295
other organs that are involved, but today
we're just going to talk about the brain.

130
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:29,115
So it's okay to feel badly when
bad things are happening to you.

131
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,695
In fact, we are wired that way.

132
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:37,305
My daughter, Sarah has told me that
over the years and, um, she's right.

133
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,435
I mean, if we.

134
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,340
If bad things are happening
and we're not feeling bad, I

135
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,660
think that's a bit of an issue.

136
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,180
Um, but through my studies in sensory
processing therapy, I can also tell

137
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,590
you that we need to get our brain
juice, our neurochemistry back to

138
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,620
an optimum level in order to move.

139
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:07,010
Um, so I did a really quick Google search
about, uh, stress, daily stress, and

140
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,140
very quickly I got thousands of hits of
research and they all tell you that yes,

141
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,880
there's a lot of stress in our lives.

142
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,800
Um, but let's get our
terminology, um, together.

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,310
Okay.

144
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:26,700
So quite often, and I'm guilty of this,
I use stress and anxiety interchangeably,

145
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,210
and it's actually not the same thing.

146
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,530
Uh, when we're talking about it,
in terms of your neurochemistry.

147
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,250
Um, several years ago, there was a really
good article in reader's digest and the

148
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,780
Canadian version because I'm in Canada
and it talked about the differences

149
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,640
between worry and stress and anxiety
and worry, worry, that's a feeling.

150
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,690
I feel worried.

152
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,410
I feel hungry.

153
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,460
I do something.

154
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,740
And that feeling goes away.

155
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,680
Whereas stress, our thoughts.

156
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,750
I can't stop thinking about it.

157
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,800
Like, you know, last night I've
got this big presentation going on.

158
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,460
Right?

159
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,670
And so you think about it and
it's hard not to think about it.

160
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,050
Um, but.

161
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,330
It does go away when that situation is
resolved, you stop thinking about it

162
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,140
and, and, uh, there's lots of things
that we can do in terms of mindfulness

163
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,900
and meditation, um, regulating
your breathing, things like that.

164
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,720
Um, that definitely helped.

165
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:40,185
Ignore those thoughts until
the stress has been resolved.

166
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:45,525
But when we're talking about unresolved
stress, now we're getting into a

167
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:52,095
physical response and that's anxiety
and that's completely different.

168
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:57,945
You didn't think your way into anxiety and
you can't think your way out of anxiety.

169
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:00,375
Let me say that again.

170
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,699
Anxiety is your body's
reaction to unresolved stress.

171
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,339
You didn't think your way into it, and
you can't think your way out of it.

172
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,780
It's a physical response.

173
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,319
You will have to physically change
something in order to move on from,

174
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,530
um, that anxiety state that you're in.

175
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,180
So, is it worry, stress or anxiety?

176
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,440
Because, you know, sometimes we think
something is, you know, maybe somebody's

177
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:42,495
personality or a habit, or maybe
they've just been, um, dealing with

178
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:47,175
unresolved stress for such a long time
that these behaviors have just become

179
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:53,475
routine and they don't realize that,
um, they, that you can actually do

180
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:56,265
something to move on from these things.

181
00:12:56,715 --> 00:13:01,995
And anger is actually just one
way that anxiety expresses itself.

182
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:02,984
All right.

183
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,275
So when we're talking about anger, we're
not talking about something completely

184
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,344
different or two sides of the coin.

185
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,604
It is the same thing in
terms of your neurobiology.

186
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:20,474
So when I was in Arizona, learning
about sensory processing, my, uh,

187
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:28,245
teacher, um, uh, Bonnie, she, um,
would talk about people with special

188
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:31,335
needs are like a rose within an onion.

189
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:37,635
You can see that beautiful sweet
person inside all these layers.

190
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,430
Uh, things of stuff that gets in the way.

191
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,560
And so with different therapies, we
can address different layers until

192
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,120
we get back to the real person,
that person who they truly are.

193
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,530
Uh, so when we're talking about
working with people with exceptional

194
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,940
needs, um, sometimes you do a therapy
and it only works for a little

195
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,830
while, and then it stops working.

196
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,925
And that's your cue that you need
to do a different kind of therapy.

197
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:07,735
All right.

198
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:09,355
So that layer has been addressed.

199
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,425
Let's go on to another layer.

200
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:17,125
And so what I'm talking about today
is that layer of neurochemistry.

201
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:23,335
Uh, and if you've been trying lots of
other things, um, like mindfulness or

202
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:28,855
behavior therapy or things like that,
and it's not working for you anymore,

203
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:32,385
maybe you need to be addressing the lady.

204
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:35,055
Of the onion that is neurochemistry.

205
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:39,945
And so psychologists have
all kinds of theories about

206
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,985
why we behave the way we do.

207
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:49,815
Um, so behaviorism, if I reward or punish,
then you can learn to stop doing that.

208
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:57,570
Cognitive, I can explain to you
why we do certain things and why,

209
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,840
what you're doing is wrong and
you can choose to not do that.

210
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,920
Um, developmental, you know
what, she's only three.

211
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,140
She's not going to be able to do that yet.

212
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:07,950
Okay.

213
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,410
So it's just, we're
waiting for that stage.

214
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,450
And then there's humanist and
there's personality theories, and

215
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,290
there are social psychology theories
and there are learning theories.

216
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:22,695
And then there's your actual brain.

217
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:23,985
Okay.

218
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:28,785
So this is your brain on slides.

219
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:34,935
And this front section here
is the prefrontal lobe.

220
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:36,945
That's where all the thinking happens.

221
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:42,945
So this is known as your thinking
brain, all the information from the

222
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:45,435
environment comes in through your senses.

223
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:50,025
Is gated by something called the
cerebellum, which I'll get to in a minute.

224
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:55,005
And it goes into the thinking
brain where it's processed.

225
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,135
You decide what to do with it.

226
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:02,835
You send that message back out to
your body and you have that behavior.

227
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:04,035
That's what you do.

228
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:13,545
Now, the hind brain or the lizard
brain is a reactionary part of your

229
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:21,795
brain and, um, for my daughter, she,
uh, because she has to bear syndrome,

230
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,395
this is an MRI slice of her brain.

231
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:30,735
These are her eyes and these places
in here where it's dark, that's

232
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,555
where the brain matter is not.

233
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:34,545
So, and.

234
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:39,714
It makes it look like there's a
molar tooth formation in there

235
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:43,525
and all people with GBR syndrome
have this molar tooth sign.

236
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:49,255
Um, so this is happening because
she's missing the  in her brain,

237
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:53,105
that gates all that information
in and out of the cerebellum.

238
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:53,915
Okay.

239
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:59,074
So kind of like you're at a horse race
and all the horses are in the gates

240
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:03,755
and the gun goes off and the gates open
and all the horses are on track and

241
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,224
they go where they're supposed to go.

242
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:14,345
Well, actually people with autism,
according to MRIs, um, have problems

243
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:18,815
with their seventh and eighth
ventricles of their vermes and

244
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,345
those are responsible for language.

245
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,915
My daughter, Erin doesn't
have a vermus at all.

246
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:31,575
So as you can imagine, things were
very, very stressful and it's not

247
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,345
a stress that she can resolve.

248
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:37,425
She's just not going to grow
back that part of her brain,

249
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:38,895
it's just not going to happen.

250
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:44,175
So there was a lot of anger and anxiety
going on with her, just trying to process

251
00:17:44,205 --> 00:17:49,035
her environment and be able to organize
things in order to, to live her life.

252
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,330
So then we have the, the middle
brain, which is your feeling

253
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,110
brain with your hypothalamus and
the thalamus and hippocampus.

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,720
And what's, what's really important
to remember is all of these things

255
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,550
in your brain and your body, they
all happen together at the same time.

256
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,180
It's kind of like, um, like baking.

257
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,290
Okay.

258
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:22,335
So like I could have sugar flour and
water and I could make bread or I could

259
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,860
make cookies or I could make paste
depending on how much of each I put in.

260
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,720
So when there's a actual
recipe, that's great.

261
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,060
Um, and you know, it doesn't work so
you check the recipe and you try again,

262
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,560
but in our bodies and in our brains,
we don't actually have a user manual.

263
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,925
There's no, Recipe, we can't find
out how many more drops of this will

264
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:54,004
stop you from doing this, or how
many more drops of this do we need

265
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,534
so that you, um, can do these things.

266
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:01,145
It's it just doesn't work that way.

267
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:08,975
So we know that these things exist,
but we're not sure exactly what levels

268
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:16,575
are what each level is at and how to
measure those levels so that you have

269
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:19,695
a recipe to make yourself feel better.

270
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:27,525
Um, now, uh, this video, um, and
I'm just looking at time and I'm

271
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,505
actually not going to play it.

272
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:34,395
It's two minute neuroscience
and it's available on YouTube.

273
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:41,264
And basically it just tells you
more about this whole thing.

274
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:45,584
Because what happens is this
stressor comes into your life.

275
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:55,035
Everything in your body works together
so that you have cortisol released into

276
00:19:55,035 --> 00:20:00,405
your system and that cortisol, which
is one of many different chemicals in

277
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:06,385
your body, that cortisol, it gets you
into the fright fight flight response.

278
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:10,525
It increases your heart rate and make
gives you more energy cause you use your

279
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,225
sugars more effectively, things like that.

280
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:19,345
And so that cortisol response,
when everything is working

281
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:24,865
optimally and the stressor is
resolved, the lion has run away.

282
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:33,855
Um, The, your neurochemistry ha
comes back to normal, which signals

283
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:38,655
the cortisol to say, oh, okay,
everything's great and the rest of you

284
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,565
goes back to an equilibrium as well.

285
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:47,115
So how do messages get through your brain?

286
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:51,945
And this is just a couple more minutes
of science and it's, it's really okay.

287
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:59,520
If this is way over your head or
you're having problems concentrating,

288
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,870
because I'm going really fast.

289
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,270
Feel free to email me.

290
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,700
I can send you an article about it.

291
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,220
Um, you can request more, uh, actual
research that other people have done.

292
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,490
Um, but the really important things and
I'm going to repeat a few times like this.

293
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:21,510
So in your brain, the messages.

294
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,960
The environment come in and they go
through your brain through nerve cells.

295
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:28,949
Okay.

296
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:31,710
But the nerve cells don't
actually touch each other.

297
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,320
There's this little
space called the synapse.

298
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:39,030
And so what actually carries the
message between from one to the

299
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,970
other, are these little things called
neuro-transmitters or biogenic and means.

300
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,790
As I say brain juice.

301
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,970
And there are lots of those.

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,430
We're only going to talk about dopamine
norepinephrine and serotonin, that's it.

303
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,465
So let's go back to the beginning where
there are all these worries and the

304
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:13,754
thoughts and there's mindfulness and yoga
and prayer and meditation and breathing

305
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:20,290
and all these things that you can do to
help those thoughts and feelings subside.

306
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,300
And then there are all these psychological
theories that can help you change the

307
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:33,040
behaviors that you have that are sometimes
due to, um, unresolved stress, which

308
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,070
we can also call anger and anxiety.

309
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:44,534
And then, the cortisol response you
get, the stress goes into, goes into

310
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:51,375
you and the cortisol kicks in and these
three neuro-transmitters say, oh wait,

311
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,195
wait, wait, we need to fix this problem.

312
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,165
So all these things.

313
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:03,975
And I'm going to talk about the layer
of just those three neuro-transmitters,

314
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:09,254
because I believe that if you've
tried all kinds of other things,

315
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:13,605
this might be the layer of the
onion that you need to address.

316
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:18,425
So how does this all
work, in real language?

317
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:22,055
So you're at your laptop and your
little brother comes in behind

318
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:26,495
you and says, boo, and one of
three things is going to happen.

319
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:30,095
Well, first of all, you're going
to get this rush of cortisol.

320
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:32,045
Cause there's this unexpected stress.

321
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,435
And then you're going to have
a fright response, flight

322
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:38,705
response, or fight response.

323
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,889
And you, you do that with, without
even thinking, because it's your

324
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,520
hindbrain that's causing this reaction.

325
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,750
That's what's going on.

326
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,330
You're not thinking about it and deciding.

327
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,830
So in my years at, um, at a high school
teaching, I used to talk to my students

328
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,480
about this and I would say, so if
this happens at your house and you hit

329
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,955
your little brother, you can tell your
parent your cortisol made you do it.

330
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:14,445
And if they don't believe you, um,
they can call me and I'll back you up.

331
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:20,955
But we can only use that excuse once,
because if the little brother shows

332
00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:25,245
up the third time and you're just
sitting there waiting, cause you know,

333
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:28,754
he's going to say boo, and in fact
you hit him before he even says, boo.

334
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,585
So that's a cognitive.

335
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,920
That's a learned response.

336
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,940
You've decided that you're
going to do that, which means

337
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,100
you can choose not to as well.

338
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,430
Whereas that fight,
fight or flight response.

339
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
Um, isn't a choice.

340
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,845
So when you're red lining, let's
say a your walking down the road

341
00:24:52,875 --> 00:25:00,794
and this big truck comes at you and
you have a fright response, a flight

342
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:06,585
response, or you have fight response
and you've seen this happen, right?

343
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:07,965
It's like that doesn't make sense.

344
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,965
Why is he trying to beat up
the truck that almost hit him?

345
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:12,825
And that's my point.

346
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:14,625
It doesn't make sense.

347
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,129
These fright fight flight
responses have nothing to do with

348
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,770
thinking it through or deciding.

349
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,080
It just happens.

350
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,320
Now in a regular situation, in a typical
brain, uh, you get out of the way of the

351
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,595
truck and suddenly the serotonin floods
into your system and says, okay, okay.

352
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:39,585
Nothing to see here.

353
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:40,635
Everything's fine.

354
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:47,115
The problems resolved and dopamine and
norepinephrine say, oh, okay, well, good.

355
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,045
It's resolved.

356
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:53,175
And they go back to normal and the
cortisone goes back to an optimum

357
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:56,325
level and you can feel this happening.

358
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:59,745
You can feel your heart rate slow down.

359
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,915
Um, you, um, can.

360
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:08,265
Um, you're aware of your breathing.

361
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:14,925
You start being aware of your environment
again, and, um, you, you can feel

362
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:19,875
this return to, um, to equilibrium.

363
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:26,085
So while you are in that
stressful situation.

364
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:35,115
The nor epinephrine's job is to keep you
focused on why is there all this dopamine,

365
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:37,275
or why is there all this cortisol?

366
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:43,215
Why is there all this cortisol, which
is really, really important if you need

367
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:48,165
to get away from a truck because you
know, you don't want to hesitate and

368
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:52,515
say, oh, that would make a great nail
Polish or, you know, shoes or something.

369
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:55,725
Um, you want to stay focused
on solving the problem.

370
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:05,550
But some problems can't be resolved, like
regrowing, a piece of your brain, or like

371
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,780
what I used to tell my students, when
your parents don't act like grownups,

372
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,760
or you have a boss that just isn't
rational or there's a global pandemic

373
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,510
or uh, the world's on the brink of war.

374
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,330
These are things that are very
stressful and can cause you to go into

375
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,280
a physical response of anxiety, but
they are not things that I can resolve

376
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,980
in order for the serotonin to show up.

377
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,149
And that's what needs to happen in
order for you to go back off that

378
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:44,820
red line and back to an equilibrium.

379
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:50,145
Let's kind of go that
through that one more time.

380
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:55,635
You're you're sitting around, you're
very relaxed and everything is optimal.

381
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,975
And then, um, it's green.

382
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:59,145
Everything's a go.

383
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,385
And then a lion shows up in your room.

384
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,695
And so you have this.

385
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:10,440
Fright fight flight response,
your dopamine, and nor upfront,

386
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,010
nor epinephrin kick in because
the cortisol has come online.

387
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,740
It's like I have to, I
have to attend to this.

388
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,640
I have to shelve this.

389
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
I have to solve this.

390
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:25,500
And then once you've gotten away from
said lion, then you stop red lining.

391
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,510
The serotonin comes back in and
says, okay guys, we did our job.

392
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,409
Everything's good.

393
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,929
And you go back to an equilibrium.

394
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:43,620
But what happens when the line is
just in another room and you're really

395
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:47,729
not sure what's going to happen next.

396
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,040
And you get into this, I'm walking
on eggshells kind of thing?

397
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:53,550
Like.

398
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:57,524
Kids who don't have, um, a good home life.

399
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,115
Um, am I going to have food?

400
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,555
Is there somebody going to be there?

401
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:01,485
Am I going to get hit?

402
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:04,514
All of these things are building up.

403
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:08,115
It might not be happening at that
exact moment, but they are still

404
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,514
dealing with those kinds of things.

405
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:18,524
And it's the same for us in our,
um, out of school situations where

406
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,254
we're dealing with unresolved stress.

407
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:22,605
It just never.

408
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,290
You just never seem to be able to relax.

409
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,330
You get this gray fog or, you know, you
just feel like at any moment, you're,

410
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,950
you're going to explode and that is PTSD.

411
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,200
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

412
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:45,435
So PTSD is not just being unable to
move on from a tram one traumatic event.

413
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:46,065
Okay.

414
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:47,205
I mean, that is true.

415
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:54,525
It's absolutely that, but it's also,
if you deal with unresolved stress

416
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,795
on a chronic years kind of level.

417
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:04,320
Then you are, you have depleted your
body of the serotonin, that it needs

418
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,440
to bring you back to an optimum
level and you are on that cortisol

419
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,120
high and you that's PTSD that.

420
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:21,015
Re you can't think your way out of that
because you didn't think your way into it.

421
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:27,285
You have to physically do something thing
to change the neurochemistry so that

422
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,325
you can move on past those thoughts.

423
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:35,415
Um, because after a while, you're not
sure if that's a kitten or a lion.

424
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:42,165
Um, so another really quick recap,
something stressful happens,

425
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,240
cortisol comes into the system.

426
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,150
Dopamine says, Hey, what's going on?

427
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,200
I want to be rewarded.

428
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,190
What's happening here.

429
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,730
Nor epinephrin says focus, focus.

430
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,840
We need to solve this problem.

431
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,820
What's going if we focus, focus,
and when it's resolved, serotonin

432
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,860
floods in and says, okay, no worries.

433
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,780
We got this it's solved.

434
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,450
And everyone goes back to normal levels.

435
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,990
Let's go back to that truck.

436
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:14,564
So a few hours later, um, you're
telling somebody that you almost

437
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:21,495
got hit by a truck today, and you
can feel your body have those same

438
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:26,804
physiological responses that you,
that you did in the real situation.

439
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,810
Just the memory of a stressful
situation can put you back into

440
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,510
a fright flight fight response.

441
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,260
Now in that truck memory,
you got out of the way.

442
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,690
And so serotonin showed up and so it
will show up again, but you will have

443
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:52,300
that same visceral response that you
did just with the memory of that event.

444
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:59,340
In fact, David Rock talks about the
scarf model, where there are human

445
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,090
social experiences that can also
put you into a fright flight fight

446
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,810
response, just like a lion in the room.

447
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,510
So, if you feel that your status
is threatened, you're uncertain

448
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,460
about outcomes, you don't feel
like you have a sense of autonomy.

449
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,090
Things don't feel related
or they're just unfair.

450
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,380
It can also get the cortisol going
into a fight, fright flight response.

451
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,100
And I don't know about you, but I've
had a couple of bosses that, you

452
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,720
know, I've definitely created a work
environment that this kind of thing

453
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,100
is, is very real and don't dismiss it.

454
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,300
It is just as real as
if a lion has shown up.

455
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,235
Quick, quick, um, Story in 2018.

456
00:32:56,865 --> 00:33:03,675
Um, my husband had a seizure at work
and we discovered that he had a tumor,

457
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:07,035
a meningioma on the top of this brain.

458
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:11,055
Uh, we had no idea that it was
there until he had this seizure

459
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:16,245
on a Saturday after Saturday
evening, they did surgery on Sunday.

460
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:16,995
They got.

461
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:18,990
It wasn't cancerous.

462
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,129
It didn't need radiation
Tuesday he came home.

463
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,700
Yeah.

464
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,690
Three days later.

465
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:25,800
Okay.

466
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,350
So my daughter, err, my
daughter, Erin was here.

467
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,050
My daughter, Sarah came home from school.

468
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,580
She was about eight hours away.

469
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,570
And of course she was studying
neuroscience and biology.

470
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,070
In fact, she was also a first
responder for, um, like a local like

471
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,945
St John's ambulance, which is, um,
You know, like medics paramedics.

472
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:55,725
Um, and so I thought on Tuesday evening,
well, he's home and Sarah is way more

473
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:58,065
qualified to watch him breathe then I am.

474
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,975
So I went back to my teaching job.

475
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:02,595
Yeah.

476
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,525
Kind of silly, but I really felt
like there were all these things

477
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:10,485
that I had to get done and it had
to get done by Friday because then

478
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,284
Sarah was going home on Sunday.

479
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:12,855
And what would I do?

480
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,909
Anyway, I went to work.

481
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,630
And this woman talked to me
in the hallway and I, I can't

482
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,279
remember exactly who she was.

483
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,060
Um, but she said, oh Karen, I'm so
sorry to hear about your husband.

484
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,889
She said, I was feeling
really bad about me.

485
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,770
And then I heard about
him and on just so sorry.

486
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,710
And I was like, oh, You're welcome.

487
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,570
I'm glad the stress of my
life helped yours feel better.

488
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,510
But see, that's not really what she meant.

489
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,820
What she meant was, um, I
was feeling really stressed

490
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,470
and feeling sorry for myself.

491
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,740
And then I heard about your situation
and I just kind of had to shake my

492
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,500
head and say, it could always be worse,
but I wish that I could remember who

493
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,415
that person was because I need to
tell her you can't compare stuff.

494
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:09,045
What's on my plate is
what I'm dealing with.

495
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,375
And what's on your plate is
what you're dealing with.

496
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:16,875
And whether it's a burger or a
steak, we're still dealing with

497
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,275
our stuff and you can't compare.

498
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:25,665
You can't say, oh, they have it so much
worse, why can't I get my stuff together?

499
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:31,410
Well, you, you don't know what's
going on with that person.

500
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,330
I mean, I go to a psychiatrist.

501
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,490
I take really good drugs to make
sure I have enough serotonin to,

502
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:43,650
uh, offset all the stress that is
unresolved stress that is in my life.

503
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:49,740
Um, I do other physical activities
to naturally increase my serotonin.

504
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:53,985
But what I've got is what I deal with.

505
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:58,815
Just like somebody with diabetes who
doesn't have enough insulin to deal

506
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:02,895
with the sugars in their system, because
their sugars and everything, some people

507
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:09,105
need more serotonin to deal with all the
stress unresolved stress in their lives.

508
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:15,225
So it's okay to feel badly when
bad things are happening to you.

509
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,815
In fact, we're wired that way.

510
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:21,045
If you didn't feel bad, I think
there was something wrong that

511
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,875
would be way more concerning for me.

512
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:28,545
Um, and we need to, uh, get our brain
juice back to an optimum level so that we

513
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:31,395
can move on from this unresolved stress.

514
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:31,875
Okay.

515
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:32,985
So the best part.

516
00:36:33,464 --> 00:36:34,515
All right, that's great.

517
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,105
What do I do about it?

518
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:43,065
Well, we need to increase our serotonin
and, and, uh, first you need to

519
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,625
remember that this is not your fault.

520
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:47,040
It's not your fault.

521
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,049
You didn't do anything to ask for this.

522
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,700
This is not a test.

523
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,759
This is not something you deserved.

524
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,129
It is not your fault.

525
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,589
It's just the way you're built.

526
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,710
People don't choose to have diabetes.

527
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,049
People don't choose to
have chronic anxiety.

528
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,509
Um, so.

529
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:10,545
If you have a little bit of stress,
you need a few drops of serotonin.

530
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:15,225
You can be out in the sun, look at
the color green, listen to some music.

531
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:18,944
Um, those were like little
droplets of serotonin.

532
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:20,115
I mean, it's not really.

533
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:22,365
It's just an analogy.

534
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,415
It's a comparison.

535
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:26,564
It's not really drops, but
that's what I'm going to use.

536
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:31,004
Because if you have a little more stress,
maybe you need a shot glass of serotonin.

537
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,814
And so that would be your tactile sense.

538
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:41,294
Um, um, a massage or a warm bath or
a weighted blanket and a weighted

539
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:44,415
blankets are really in right now.

540
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,410
People are very aware of the
benefits of that kind of therapy.

541
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,560
And that's good because we
need to be aware of that.

542
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,080
But sometimes you need
even more than that.

543
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,730
And so then you need to use one of your
internal census called proprioception,

544
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,790
and that's where your body is in space.

545
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:08,615
And, um, when you do joint compressions
from running or lifting weights or

546
00:38:08,615 --> 00:38:12,725
things like that, then you get like
a glassful of serotonin and that

547
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:17,404
will last in your system for like an
hour or so um, according to studies.

548
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:23,525
But the biggest bang for your
buck is the vestibular sense

549
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,444
or where your head is in space.

550
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,870
So if you can get your head moving
around, It's going to be like a bucket

551
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,689
of serotonin going into your system.

552
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:40,080
And so that's like swinging or jumping
or being on a roller coaster, or

553
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:44,700
I don't know if any of, you know,
people that have a boat and they say,

554
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,240
once I'm on the boat, 15 minutes,
I don't have a care in the world.

555
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,240
And I can tell you that it's true.

556
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:53,535
And it's not because of the beer.

557
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:59,145
It's because that gentle,
rocking motion is increasing

558
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:02,235
their serotonin exponentially.

559
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:05,915
And so the dopamine and norepinephrine
go, oh, look, there's all this

560
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:08,505
serotonin, I guess we solved the problem.

561
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:15,990
And everything goes back to an optimal
level and that's what we need in

562
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:22,740
order to move on from those behaviors
caused by chronic anxiety and anger.

563
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:28,169
So there's, um, there is
peer research behind all this

564
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,609
stuff that I'm talking about.

565
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:35,645
And, um, if you would like a
copy of a list of those research

566
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,294
articles, please email me.

567
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,615
I can send that to you.

568
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:44,044
I also have an article which kind
of recaps everything I've just

569
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:47,404
talked about in the last 40 minutes.

570
00:39:48,004 --> 00:39:53,955
Um, but please don't let
people burst your bubble.

571
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:55,904
Don't just suck it up.

572
00:39:56,205 --> 00:40:00,104
I mean, that's, that's what I was
raised as you know, like this baby

573
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:01,665
boomer thing where, oh, suck it up.

574
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:02,685
Don't let them see you sweat.

575
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,515
Well, that's not healthy.

576
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:10,214
And my kids who are millennials will
tell me, no, you have to take a step

577
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:15,345
back and deal with your mental health
otherwise it will affect your physical

578
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,354
health and you can't just get through it.

579
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:18,495
And you know what?

580
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,625
Everybody has stuff.

581
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,350
Everybody.

582
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,500
It's okay to not be okay all the time.

583
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,480
That's the way we're wired.

584
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,990
And it's good to need someone else.

585
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,690
I mean, I wish we could be
doing this live and in person.

586
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,590
Okay.

587
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,360
Because then you could look around at your
colleagues and say, I'm not the only one

588
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,000
that feels this way because you're not.

589
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,260
You're not the only one and
their safety in numbers.

590
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,700
It's good to need somebody else.

591
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,359
Um, exercise is really important.

592
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,240
Um, listen to your body.

593
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,549
If you have like irritable bowel
syndrome, you had indigestion

594
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,890
those kinds of digestion issues.

595
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,690
That's because there's a whole
lot of serotonin in your gut that

596
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,000
keeps things running optimally.

597
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,710
So if you're low on serotonin in
your brain, you're probably going

598
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,660
to be low in serotonin in your gut.

599
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:27,930
And you're going to, um, you're going to
be off things aren't going to be working.

600
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,380
But more importantly, play.

601
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,890
You know, um, swing on a swing.

602
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,920
I bought a little hammock swing for $60
and I have it hanging in my basement.

603
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,930
And I go use that when I know that
things are stressful, I'll go on a

604
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,930
roller coaster dance, things like that.

605
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,000
But, what will you do?

606
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:59,170
Pick one of these things that increases
your serotonin and, and try it.

607
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:05,195
Make room for it, put it somewhere
on your plate or take something off

608
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:06,905
your plate so that you have that time.

609
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:12,695
And then in three months, go back
to that baseline behavior that we

610
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:16,745
identified at the beginning of our
time together and theoretically,

611
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:18,905
it shouldn't be happening as often.

612
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:21,965
I'd love to know how that works for you.

613
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:25,235
Email me and let me know.

614
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,770
That's really what it's all about
is being with other people and

615
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:38,609
knowing how your system works
and what you can do to help it.

616
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,490
Um, we have about three minutes for
questions, uh, but we can absolutely go

617
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:48,629
into the community tent and have a longer
discussion if people would like that.

618
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,610
Mike Demo: Hello and welcome back.

619
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,020
So that was, uh, an amazing talk, Karen.

620
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,870
And, um, we actually don't have
time for questions, but you'll be

621
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:07,510
in the community tent where you, um,
you'll be hosting an intimate, um,

622
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,180
Q and a where people can learn more.

623
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,430
And it's funny, you talk about breathing.

624
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:18,194
I have on my desk, it's a little inhaler
type device which, um, counts my breaths

625
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,435
and tries to slow down your breathing.

626
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:23,075
So you breathe into it, vibrates
you, then you breathe in.

627
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:29,075
And so, um, this is an FDA device
that I use with my, um, therapist.

628
00:43:29,435 --> 00:43:33,545
And, um, so when you were talking
about breathing, I looked down at that,

629
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,015
I'm like, oh, he reminds me of that.

630
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:39,920
So, um, And we have lots of questions
so please go over to the community tent.

631
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,260
We actually have a 15
minute break right now.

632
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,190
So please head over to the community
tent and chat with the sponsors.

633
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,050

00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:43,035
Cathy Tibbles: Thank you.

649
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:43,455
Thanks.

650
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:45,405
Mike Demo: Excellent.

651
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:48,495
So again, we're on a 15 minute break,
go head over to the community tent,
