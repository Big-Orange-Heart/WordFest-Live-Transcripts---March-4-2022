Corey's a 20 plus year design veteran
and the agency owner and agency

43
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:16,085
owner based in Geelong, Australia.

44
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:19,055
He has built, designed team.

45
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:27,675
And directed large scale projects,
mentored designers and developers in

46
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:33,885
both one-on-one and group settings, and
works with a huge number of national

47
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,375
and local brands across the country.

48
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:41,565

50
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,925
So let's welcome, Corey!

51
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:53,594
Corey Dodd: Hello?

52
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,844
I hope you're enjoying WordFest.

53
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,335
Thanks for taking some time out
to listen to me talk about design.

54
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:05,535
This is my presentation called the five
quick tips to level up your design.

55
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:09,345
And in this presentation, I
want to walk through what it

56
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,165
means to do better design work.

57
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,795
I believe when we do better
work, we can charge more and we

58
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:17,475
get to work with better clients.

59
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,995
Design has been extremely valuable for me.

60
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,425
It has paid for my entire life.

61
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:23,865
So who am I?

62
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,155
My name is Corey.

63
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:29,325
I've been doing this for over
20 years, nearly 25 years.

64
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:33,495
I've worked for all sorts of
places, small agencies, large

65
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:38,445
agencies, national agencies, and
I run my own agency, Elk Creative.

66
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,664
I have been teaching other designers, I've
mentored other designers and I've recently

67
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:48,494
completed a course teaching designers, how
to build websites with no code in Oxygen.

68
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:53,130
I'm taking a bit of a turn here and
giving away some of my design tips.

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,330
So buckle in, because we
have a lot to get through.

70
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,440
All right.

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,370
Let's not mess around.

72
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:06,060
Let's get into tip number one, creating
layouts, that command attention.

73
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,470
Now the best place to start, or
the easiest place to start with.

74
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,090
This is through the use of
hierarchy in our layouts.

75
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,490
Now, what is hierarchy and why is it in.

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,180
Both very good questions, which
we're going to answer now.

77
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,490
So hierarchy is essentially a design
principle that draws from a lot of

78
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,850
different areas or elements of design,
things like color, scale, contrast,

79
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,910
alignment, position, proximity, and also
things like patterns and repetition.

80
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,540
Now these can be used
individually or together.

81
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,280
To bring attention to
certain areas of our website.

82
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,210
Now hierarchy, isn't actually about
what appears first in a design, but

83
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,900
what commands the most attention or
where we want to draw the users are.

84
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,000
And a really good real world
example of this is something

85
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,640
like a podium at the Olympics.

86
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,440
Now this is a great example because, well,
when we look at this, we can see that it

87
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,705
goes from second, to first, to third and
naturally the logic would say that we

88
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:20,655
go first, second, third, or maybe third,
second, first up to the first place.

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,920
But what they've done with a podium
is put the first person in the middle,

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,550
the winner in the middle, and then
giving them an elevated stance.

91
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,750
This means that even if you don't know,
or you've never seen a podium before,

92
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,450
it becomes pretty obvious who the most
important person on that podium is.

93
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,490
We can really clearly see through
the hierarchy there what's going.

94
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,910
Now in page layouts, this is
going to look something like this.

95
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,280
Now of course, these are just examples.

96
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,050
Um, but you can see on the left here that
if we're giving everything the same amount

97
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,229
of work, It becomes almost impossible
to pull out anything of any importance.

98
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,210
It all just looks the same.

99
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,950
Whereas if we look at the layout on the
right, what we're seeing is through the

100
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,090
use of highlighting different things
with different sizes, highlighting

101
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,430
things with color, using space, repeating
the same sorts of elements, grouping

102
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,700
things together where told a story, and
we can focus on one thing at a time.

103
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:28,830
Okay.

104
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,400
Now, what does this look
like in the real world?

105
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,299
I'm going to open up a real
world example of a site that

106
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,500
I'm working on at the moment.

107
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,900
Now this isn't the full redesign.

108
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,579
This is actually just re-imagining this
page without actually changing anything.

109
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,560
So I want to stress here that, um,
that this is just an example only.

110
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,430
So let's take it.

111
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,395
Now you can see here,
there is a lot going on.

112
00:08:55,815 --> 00:09:00,855
It's probably more problems than actually
just simple hierarchy here, but a lot

113
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:06,135
of this can be fixed just by focusing on
some of those areas, areas of hierarchy.

114
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,305
Just to get some focus back now,
overall, there's a lot of strength

115
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,955
on the, on the fonts there.

116
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,355
I want to pull all this stuff back.

117
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:20,945
Um, and generally I want to
just pull back, um, of the focus

118
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:23,015
and make it a bit more softer.

119
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:26,825
Um, and then focus on
some of the hierarchy.

120
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,555
So some of the key things that
I can see is the navigation is

121
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,505
absolutely huge for no reason.

122
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:36,255
We've got headings that are basically
bunting up against each other,

123
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:40,245
that we can't tell if they're
their headings or their buttons.

124
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,574
Um, we've also got some things.

125
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,610
Uh, drawing too much attention rather
than not getting enough, like this

126
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,780
green background behind the water
biodiversity and land projects.

127
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,680
For some reason, this is brighter
than the other sections there.

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
Those four key sections.

129
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,390
And so actually is demanding
a bit more attention.

130
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,760
Okay, I'm going to fix
these three key areas.

131
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,880
I'm going to go through
these step by step.

132
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:14,489
So the first thing I look at is just
reducing the type of graphy I've

133
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,420
pulled out that background there, and
you can already say this is so much

134
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,969
cleaner, but, and a lot more focused.

135
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,280
I've given it a little bit
of padding around the low.

136
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,065
And I've still got this issue with
the contact and the portal buttons.

137
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,985
I really believed that the functionality
of these is probably similar in the fact

138
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:36,405
that our user isn't going to use them
like the rest of the navigation, that

139
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,485
almost like bouncing kind of sections.

140
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:41,415
Someone's going to land on the
site and either click contact and

141
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,535
then leave, or they're going to
bounce and head off to this portal.

142
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,655
So we might as well group these together.

143
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:51,465
So the person isn't actually jumping
from left to right left to right there's

144
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,655
attention is poured into one area.

145
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,515
Now looking at these right
now, they are probably too big.

146
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:02,925
I've just done this in the CSS
for this example, just to get us

147
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:06,075
an idea of what we're trying to
do, but they do feel a little big.

148
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,965
So probably in the real world would scare.

149
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,079
Back.

150
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,219
Um, but you can see that it is giving
that navigation a lot more focus.

151
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,959
It becomes a lot more functionable.

152
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,610
All right.

153
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,130
The next thing we tackle here is these
four primary sections on the homepage.

154
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,450
What I've done is reduced that
color, the brightness behind the

155
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,410
water biodiversity section, you
can see that already more balanced.

156
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,270
I've increased the sizes of the images,
added a bit more padding around the

157
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,170
headings, and we can see this is
now taking up about half the page.

158
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,785
And it's clear that these are kind of
the primary things on the home page.

159
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:49,505
Now it's to help the user
understand there's four key

160
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:54,035
areas, and there's a guess four
journeys that people can head down.

161
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,704
If they're looking for permit type
information, or if they're looking

162
00:11:56,704 --> 00:12:00,094
at about how to get involved, for
example, it becomes a lot clearer

163
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,755
that these are headings and their
sections within those headings.

164
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:10,575
Now, lastly, I've just added a lot and I'm
in a lot of space around these buttons.

165
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,305
They were being lost again.

166
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,155
If I was, if this was a real
project, I may be trying to,

167
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:17,475
re-imagine how they look.

168
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:22,875
But really essentially what I was trying
to do with this example is show how much

169
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,095
impact we can make without changing.

170
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:27,355
Well, the design itself.

171
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,105
So you can see here
with the left or right.

172
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,615
What's really happening here
is we've we've I guess, got

173
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:36,415
some more focus in the design.

174
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,225
It's a lot more calmer and it's
a lot easier for the person, the

175
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,855
user to know what they should be
doing at any one point in time.

176
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:44,940
Now.

177
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,800
Yes, we've lost some real estate.

178
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,230
And most of that is through the space that
I've added around those three buttons down

179
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,990
the bottom, but overall, we're getting
a lot more professional, a lot more,

180
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,680
um, you know, user friendly, our layout.

181
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Now this design, now isn't going to win
any awards, but it's certainly a lot

182
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,460
cleaner and a lot more professional.

183
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,780
And because it's a lot easier for the
customer to use, we're going to see

184
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,760
that there's more value for our clients.

185
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,810
So this really is a leveling up our
design without really doing anything.

186
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,790
There's been no changes in the order.

187
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,200
Apart from those buttons,
it's just changing the focus.

188
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,680
All right, now let's
get into tip number two.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,510
Choosing colors that don't suck.

190
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,510
Now this is some color tips
or maybe it's a rant, but it's

191
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,100
colors come up quite a lot.

192
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,660
People ask how do I find colors or how
do I work with colors of the difficult.

193
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:53,785
Often, what I see happening is
people linking to things that are

194
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:58,195
color generators or their favorite
color palettes, which is all well

195
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:02,755
and good, but this isn't the best
way to tackle this situation.

196
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,715
Now I'm not talking about
situations where clients don't

197
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,365
have existing assets, like low.

198
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,650
If this happens and you're creating
some, a website, it's going to be

199
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,090
difficult to know where to start.

200
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,220
And it's kind of a bit of a branding
exercise to create colors for them.

201
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,010
But in situations where clients have
colors, maybe they've got a style guide

202
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,500
and maybe they've got an existing logo.

203
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,010
Maybe they have some already
existing marketing material.

204
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,520
These are the places we
need to get our colors.

205
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,320
We need to work with the colors that
they have, if not, we're actually

206
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,550
doing that client and that brand
a bit of a disservice, we're kind

207
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,850
of removing some of that brand
equity that they have developed.

208
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,740
Now it's all very good to think
about things like color theory.

209
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,480
And I'm not going to stop anyone
from going down that path, educating

210
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,630
themselves on how color works is great.

211
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,770
There are six basic color
schemes, or there is a seventh,

212
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,280
we've got monochromatic,
complimentary split complimentary.

213
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,980
And now I guess, triad triadic.

214
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,329
And there is a seventh one, which is a
square a, which is very much like the

215
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,209
triadic, uh, color scheme, right there.

216
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,320
That's great to know about
these things and how they work.

217
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,300
But as I've said, if a client
has an existing color scheme,

218
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,670
we should be working with this.

219
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,470
Even if we do not feel that this
color scheme is right now, one

220
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,280
of the best ways to work with
this is to lean into the color.

221
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,680
Now a lot of people actually back
away from color and they think if I

222
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,170
use less of it, then this will help.

223
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,550
Now I'm going to show a couple of
real world examples where I've worked

224
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,680
with colors that, uh, almost seemed
against the proposition of the brand

225
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,720
or what someone was trying to achieve.

226
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
Now let's take a look
at this first one here.

227
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:07,439
This project, this was a childcare
center and they wanted something that

228
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,770
was light and bright and energetic.

229
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,489
And this was the logo and
identity that they had.

230
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:18,209
Now, this was being used
in signage and on vehicles.

231
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,880
It wasn't something that
was going to be changed.

232
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:27,285
We want it to work with this color and
this well, this logo, and really grab

233
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:32,685
the things in it and still trying to
achieve that bright looking website.

234
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:38,685
Now this is what they already have,
and this is what a perfect example of

235
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:44,205
someone pulling away, um, rather than
sort of really grabbing those dark colors.

236
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:44,475
Those.

237
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,645
Bright oranges and the
yellows, you haven't even used.

238
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:55,035
The black of condom pulled away from this
and used colors that were, um, like white.

239
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:59,685
And even in some examples, there
were stuff like sands in, et cetera.

240
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:03,825
Um, in the other pages now that's the
only screenshot I have left of this site.

241
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:08,055
Um, there is another example
of how they were using this on

242
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:11,505
their marketing material and the
stuff that we've done with them.

243
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,445
So this is the actual site.

244
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,485
This is what we've produced for them.

245
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:21,015
And you can see I'm really
actually embracing that dark color.

246
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:26,085
Um, now there are four sections in this
where the colors like the orange and

247
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:28,875
the reds take over the whole screen.

248
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:35,025
They really become a key feature,
but this is still light and bright,

249
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:39,705
have introduced a few graphical
elements, um, a few playful things

250
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,595
to sort of add to that tone.

251
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:47,100
But all up, even with the use of
strong colors, light blacks, and

252
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,449
reds, we're still able to make
something that is really bright and

253
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,520
vibrant, which is a part of the brief.

254
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,330
Again, let's have a quick look
at how this was used before

255
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,679
and after in their marketing.

256
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,740
He can see again on that left side
there, that they were almost probably

257
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,990
scared to embrace that black.

258
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,100
So that views this sort of
like a wood grain in the

259
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,290
background and these white areas.

260
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Whereas we've now embraced that
black as a part of it and using those

261
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,810
colors to sort of punch through and
really give some bright vibrancy.

262
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,860
Now it may have felt wrong to
have worked with the black.

263
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,710
Kind of embracing that and embracing
that dark color really come up with

264
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,700
something that's A unique, B on brand,
and C still fits the brief of creating

265
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,220
something that's brought energetic and
well suitable for a childcare center.

266
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,570
Now I do have another example
where a similar thing happened.

267
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,290
Now again, I've just got the
left and the right examples here.

268
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,840
Now this is another children's charity
or it's another child based, um,

269
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,060
client, but it's a children's charity.

270
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,040
Now their logo literally has
like seven or eight colors in it.

271
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,350
And the old website and the
old marketing material didn't

272
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,670
really embrace the current.

273
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,870
They kind of just use a little bits of
the colors as highlights here and there.

274
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,800
Um, you can see that donate
button isn't even the right color.

275
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,419
So there we go.

276
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,560
Now, what we did when we started
working with them was we actually

277
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,120
embrace that color a lot more.

278
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,149
A core thing that we did was we chose a
one color as the hero, which was the blue.

279
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,800
And then we using all these other colors
as highlights and we're using them

280
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,510
quite often, actually every single color
is represented in the site, even for

281
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,100
blog categories and things like that.

282
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,139
But the real important thing here
was the, we embraced that color now.

283
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:54,040
They've actually gone on to use this as
their marketing material and their, and

284
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,330
their base for their marketing material.

285
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,909
They've even had vehicle wraps,
et cetera, done with this.

286
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,889
So you can see what happens
when we actually embrace some.

287
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:09,225
Now working with color is actually a lot
of fun and it can be challenging, but if

288
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:14,475
you change your beliefs around stuff that
you don't like, and actually really lean

289
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:19,695
into the color, you can look for solutions
in there that still fulfill the brief.

290
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:23,445
And again, this can really elevate
your work and make it stand out.

291
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:27,735
And so it looks better in your
portfolio and it's very appealing.

292
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,750
You deliver more value to your customer.

293
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,810
So that's the last point
on to make about color?

294
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,860
All right.

295
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,290
On to tip number three,
getting your spacing.

296
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,700
Perfect.

297
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,160
Now this is all about white the
space, and you may be thinking

298
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,930
with white space of something that
looks out a little bit like this.

299
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:56,235
Now, this is a project I'm working
on at the moment, and yes, it's uses

300
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:59,805
a lot of white space, but I want
to point out that white space has

301
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,235
nothing to do with the color white.

302
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:06,705
You have a white space on any
color background or with any image

303
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:11,145
background, but it's essentially
just the space that we have between

304
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,565
elements that gives it room to breathe.

305
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,775
Now it's a great tool to master.

306
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:23,115
And it can actually really change
the tone of a business's website,

307
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:28,034
make it look a lot more professional
or cheap, depending on the amount

308
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:30,405
of space that you want to use now.

309
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:34,274
Yes, not every single website we
work on is an expensive product.

310
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,875
And so we can change the amount
of white space, but there are

311
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,685
still some simple things that
we can look out for with spaces.

312
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:48,520
But if I'm going to give one tip around
white space, it's that we should be giving

313
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,250
it more white space than we normally do.

314
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,460
I very rarely see websites where
there's too much space and I always see

315
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,920
websites where there's not enough space.

316
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,170
So again, let's have a look at
a couple of quick examples here.

317
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,540
This is a website that I have
with a client, and this is the.

318
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,850
I want to show you the after and there's
a lot going on here, but you can already

319
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,870
see the amount of white space that's been
added to actually change how this looks.

320
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,810
The design has changed a lot overall.

321
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,120
So I'm going to focus in on a few
elements on the actual page and just

322
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,510
break down where some of the white
space has been used to add a little

323
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,340
bit more of, um, a little bit more
class and a little bit more focus.

324
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:42,525
So here, we've got
essentially the same content.

325
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:46,635
We've got your local acknowledgeable
global opportunities and our vision.

326
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:52,995
Now what I've done here is actually
allowed more space, um, between eight

327
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:55,395
elements of the stuff isn't so crammed in.

328
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:59,385
If you look on the left-hand side,
we've got a few spacing issues where

329
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:04,485
our, our vision has a strange gap
between the text and the image.

330
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,310
But then the space top and bottom
between where the text is and in the

331
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,640
gray box, it's all really, really tight.

332
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,470
Um, and this just makes it feel kind
of cluttered and almost claustrophobic

333
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,520
and contrast what I've got here on
the right hand side is something that

334
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:28,160
really breathes as a little bit less
content on the actual page, but it has

335
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,590
a lot more focus and a lot more class.

336
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,170
Again, let's have a look
at another element here.

337
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,620
We've got four projects and
we are saying, take a look at

338
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,300
some of our latest projects.

339
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,120
And there's a few key elements here.

340
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,030
There's a few differences
I'm using rollovers.

341
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,090
So when they roll over, they see
that additional information rather

342
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,889
than trying to ram it all in.

343
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,570
But if you look on the left-hand side,
there's some examples where the text gets

344
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:01,825
crazily close to the buttons, and this
just makes it look really really cheap or

345
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:04,315
that it hasn't been planned out very well.

346
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:09,325
So this is just something to keep
an eye on to, to pay attention to

347
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,274
where spacing really, it matters.

348
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:13,524
Now you can just see the difference.

349
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:17,995
I've used a logo and the image
is just adding so much stuff.

350
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:22,620
So by reducing some of those things,
um, we're actually making it easier for

351
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,090
the person to understand what it is.

352
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,130
All they need to know is
that these are projects.

353
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,640
These ones have been sold out, and if
they want to click the view project and

354
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,060
they can find out that information, they
don't need to know all of that stuff

355
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,470
upfront or were making that assumption.

356
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,504
All right now, this is the last part.

357
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:43,385
This is just looking at something
that's really, really obvious here.

358
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:47,135
This is a part of their
footer in their about page.

359
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:50,135
Um, and we've got some core values.

360
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:54,185
Now I've used up a lot
of space around this.

361
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,975
Um, I've got that information centered.

362
00:24:57,155 --> 00:25:03,095
There's a lot of space above and beside
these values and it really just makes

363
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:05,225
these things feel like they're important.

364
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,200
Now, this is actually the values
of the businesses are the things

365
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,460
that they're meant to stand for.

366
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,150
This.

367
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,500
Shouldn't be like cluttered and an an
end note that hasn't really been thought

368
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
through in the website design itself.

369
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,790
So it's really important with our
white space, what we're saying

370
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,130
and what we're trying to achieve.

371
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,930
And that's really important.

372
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:35,775
The way that we use space actually
tells a story and just like hierarchy

373
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:38,055
it, they kind of go hand in hand.

374
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:44,295
It gives us some room to breathe when
we're looking at content and it just adds

375
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:47,475
a level of class to the work that we do.

376
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:53,655
So pay attention to white space,
make friends with white space

377
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:57,405
and now on to tip number four.

378
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:02,760
Why keeping things consistent is the key.

379
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,000
And yes, this is all about consistency.

380
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:10,290
And this might be an angle that
you've taken with clients yourself.

381
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,050
So why is consistency important?

382
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,070
Well, when things are
consistent, they are familiar.

383
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,160
When they're familiar, we
are comfortable with them.

384
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,330
We want to learn things like where
the navigation is, and we don't

385
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,130
want to relearn those things.

386
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,860
When we jump from page to page, we want
to feel like we're in the same place.

387
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:36,585
Yes, we want a little bit of variety,
but we don't want to feel distracted

388
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:41,505
or uncomfortable because the
opposite is true with consistency.

389
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:46,695
When things are inconsistent, they
lead to people feeling uncomfortable.

390
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:51,645
They lead to them, subconsciously
questioning other things like the

391
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:53,865
quality of the actual supplies.

392
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,045
That's a really big deal.

393
00:26:57,525 --> 00:27:01,995
And that's why consistency
is so important.

394
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:07,515
Now I'm going to try and show here
the balance between getting things

395
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:13,215
consistent and having things as
well, quite various at the same time.

396
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,925
And that is a bit of a balancing act.

397
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:19,725
Now there are a few things that you can
do, and that is setting like global ideas.

398
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,440
Having global colors and having
the same amount of spacing, getting

399
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,530
those things right, is really
going to keep things consistent.

400
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,970
But let's take a look at a bit of
a project and we'll just go through

401
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,610
some of the difference between
the old site where things are

402
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,470
consistent and then the new one.

403
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,450
So you can see here, this is a
site I've worked on for content

404
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,280
snare, and this is the oldest site.

405
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,160
If we go through each
page, what you'll see.

406
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,060
Is that there starts to get some
inconsistency in consistencies,

407
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,649
around the colors that are used, the
amount of space for areas, the sizing

408
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,770
of fonts, the types of backgrounds
that are being used, the lack of

409
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,800
backgrounds and even the height of areas.

410
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:09,330
So if we look at those exact same
pages where we've got the home page

411
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,459
here, now, this is the rate is on.

412
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:12,719
It's a totally different brand.

413
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,905
I understand that we're just actually
looking at the space here, not

414
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,254
the brand that I've created here.

415
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:21,705
Um, and this is a totally different
design, but you can see, there

416
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:22,995
are some things we've got here.

417
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:27,825
Like if we jump from page to
page, we can see that these all

418
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,925
have the same sort of height.

419
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:31,905
Um, for the, the actual header.

420
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,145
We've got a similar thing where we've
got a little blue heading the white,

421
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:37,245
heading blue, heading white heading.

422
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:38,895
We've got this large text.

423
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,045
And we've got large texts used here.

424
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:47,445
These things are kept the same size, but
even when we jump from this templates

425
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:53,565
page here and our home page, this goes
from a dark purple to a light purple.

426
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:58,305
But the spacing here where this.is,
and though that bright goes from

427
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:02,325
the purple and on this one where
it goes to the white is the same.

428
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:05,655
We're keeping all of that
spacing feeling very consistent.

429
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:13,455
Now the reason why this is so important
is because we're really showing

430
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:18,825
the users that they're in the same
place, getting things consistent was

431
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:23,445
actually a really important part of
this project was something that people

432
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:28,215
had pointed out to them and they
knew that consistency was an issue.

433
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,715
Now, one of the things that really
helped with this was to actually

434
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:37,304
design everything upfront and not
to design in the browser as we go.

435
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:42,074
This meant that we had a total
overarching idea of what the site

436
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,415
was and what elements we had.

437
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:49,574
And then beyond actually just
creating a few core pages rather

438
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:51,074
than designing a page by page.

439
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,909
We actually created a pattern library.

440
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:57,600
So what our call to actions would
look like what our cards would look

441
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,240
like, custom layout, our heroes, our
signers, various things like that.

442
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,580
We created a library for this, and
that meant that we kept the zone, the

443
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,590
design itself, and the website really
consistent, but also vibrant and energetic

444
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,600
at the same time, it gave it a really
polished look and an amazing end result.

445
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:23,985
So keep working on consistency
because it is the key.

446
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:33,855
All right now on to the last point, point
number five, using typography to say more.

447
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:39,255
Now, obviously this is about
typography, which is a big topic.

448
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:43,215
If I was going to pick a one thing
to talk about with typography,

449
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:48,775
it is the personality of type
choosing the right typeface.

450
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,205
It really is important.

451
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:56,205
A lot of people have their go to typeface
and Montserrat won't fix every problem.

452
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:58,605
So what we need to consider.

453
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:02,885
When we choose a typeface
is what we're trying to say.

454
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:08,675
Look at the topography and see what
it says, how it makes you feel.

455
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:15,125
It becomes pretty obvious when a font
is elegant or when a font is fun.

456
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Now, I'm going to show a couple
of examples and I'm going to

457
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,590
actually point out my website and
I'm going to show that we've the

458
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,960
actual type just quickly messed up.

459
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,250
So you can see here that I've
just used a default font and.

460
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:36,720
Totally totally changes the actual
personality of the type there.

461
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,990
And you can see, this is what
I actually have led with.

462
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,100
This is the type that I do use, and
this is sort of friendly type, and

463
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,210
that's a really, really important
let's put them side by side and

464
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,710
you can see the difference here.

465
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,920
So yes, there's one that has a
separate weight, but it's more

466
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,880
than the way it's actually the
letter shapes that actually change.

467
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,055
Feel of the design itself.

468
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:02,265
It changes the message that
we're trying to communicate.

469
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:06,105
And I'm going to move on and I'm
going to show you another example.

470
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:11,145
I'm using my site again here, and I'm
going to compare this to my agency site.

471
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,205
So this is the site for
the agency that I run.

472
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:19,725
And this also has a typeface that I
would say is a little bit of fun as well.

473
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:24,405
It's got some personality, but it's
clearly a little bit more considered.

474
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:26,145
It's trying to position me as.

475
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,285
Uh, a conscious and authority person.

476
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:33,155
Who's thinking about design and
that's really important, but it

477
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:36,275
still has a fun and casual element.

478
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:40,775
If we put them side by side, we can
see the difference between them.

479
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:41,885
The left hand.

480
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:42,754
One is well.

481
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,845
Childish, but it really,
really is inviting.

482
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:51,495
And it really is trying to say that
I'm a friend, that's literally what the

483
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:55,905
word says, but the typeface as well,
I'm trying to actually be really, really

484
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:57,554
casual, but really, really friendly.

485
00:32:58,304 --> 00:33:02,685
Now on the right hand side, I'm still
trying to show that I have personality,

486
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:05,324
but it's just a lot more serious.

487
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:11,655
So the important thing that I want to
point out with type is how much personal.

488
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:13,605
Actually conveys.

489
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:19,455
So should think about the typefaces that
we use because when we choose the wrong

490
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:25,965
type face, we can send the wrong message
and the wrong type face or bad typography

491
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:29,415
can really let a design down on the whole.

492
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:34,155
Now, if we get it right, we can
actually elevate how designs and come

493
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:36,555
up with something that is far superior.

494
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:41,805
And that wraps up the presentation.

495
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,085
Thank you very much
for spending your time.

496
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:48,254
I know we covered a lot and
it was a bit of a whirlwind.

497
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:54,615
So hopefully you can see that just by
applying a few basic design principles,

498
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:57,975
how much you can level up your design.

499
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:03,135
Now, if this is something that is of
interest to you, I will be sticking

500
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:05,835
around and answering questions,
which will be super exciting.

501
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,570
But also I'd love to hear your feedback.

502
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,830
Email me corey@coreydodd.com.

503
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:17,429
And now that I've finished my Oxygen
course, I am considering putting

504
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,320
together a course about this.

505
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,730
So visit the site, https://coreydodd.com.

506
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:28,679
Look for the course design masters,
and sign up to express your interest.

507
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:33,030
I'd love to see if other people are
interested in learning about this.

508
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,790
All right, let's get
these questions going.

509
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,420
Olamide Egbayelo: Thank you Corey,
that was a really awesome session.

510
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,670
Um, I learned so much about, um,
designing and all of that, but yeah.

511
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:53,110
Welcome to welcome everyone to
the question and answer session.

512
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,670
If you have questions, please do
not hesitate to share with us.

513
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,390
Okay.

514
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,759
So I have quite a number
of questions here.

515
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:08,745
So you talked a lot about consistency,
so how do designers stay consistent?

516
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:13,785
I mean, you have to think about tools
you need to use and getting the best out,

517
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,405
and then you still need to be consistent.

518
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,875
So can you tell us more about that?

519
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:18,885
Corey Dodd: Yeah.

520
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:23,235
So consistency really is one
of the most important things.

521
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:25,845
I think when you're working
within specifically a website,

522
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:27,195
it shouldn't be so hard.

523
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:29,475
It gets harder when you're
walking, working across multiple.

524
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:33,105
Multiple projects or multiple mediums.

525
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:37,005
So if you're working on a print
document, for example, um, as a

526
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:40,305
designer, my job is generally to create
style guides for brands, and that

527
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,835
helps with keeping that consistent.

528
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:43,095
It gives people an idea.

529
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:47,505
Um, you know exactly what type of graffiti
they're using, um, you know, how they're

530
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:51,585
meant to talk even in their, in their
language, um, and how design elements

531
00:35:51,585 --> 00:35:52,905
should look and how they should feel.

532
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,805
Um, but when you're working on your
own projects, it's really about, um,

533
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:02,505
creating I guess, a group of rules that
you want to, to, to have as, as your, um,

534
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:07,635
I guess to structure the website around,
um, and a really good way to do that

535
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:10,905
is to design one part of the website.

536
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,635
First, maybe you're designing up the
homepage and then try and look at

537
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,165
ways that you can reuse elements.

538
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,095
And then rather than sort of starting from
scratch, using the exact same elements

539
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:23,885
and just slightly changing them, you know,
to suit the content you've got right,

540
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,535
rather than re-imagining them every time.

541
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:31,125
So I use really like, um,
well-defined color palettes.

542
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:34,154
So the color palettes I use
are often quite small and I'll

543
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:35,504
stick to them quite rigidly.

544
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:41,745
I won't add the new colors just because
I, um, I want to, and I think that's

545
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:43,095
another thing about consistency.

546
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:46,035
It's about, it's about working
with the things that you've got and

547
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:49,725
sometimes you feel like you want to
do something just because you want

548
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:53,055
to, because it feels final because you
think I need to draw some attention.

549
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,779
And it's trying to get away from just
doing the things that are, that you

550
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,440
desire to do, just because it seems
like fun and just sticking to the,

551
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:03,360
to the rules, which sounds boring.

552
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,299
But if you work within it, you
actually get a lot better work,

553
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,330
a lot more consistant work.

554
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,089
Olamide Egbayelo: Oh, great.

555
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,390
Thank you for the wonderful answer.

556
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:16,440
So, um, before I go to the
audience questions, um, I also

557
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,360
have one other question for you.

558
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,850
So, uh, talk about planning.

559
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,810
Um, planning is actually one of
the most important part of design.

560
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,300
And, um, so what, how
many hours do you think.

561
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,600
What duration do you think that
the designers should focus on

562
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,460
planning the design process?

563
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,580
So how long should the
design process go in?

564
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:42,990
How long should you plan?

565
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:45,299
Corey Dodd: Yeah, that's a tough one.

566
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:48,089
It depends on the size of the project,
obviously, but if you're talking about

567
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,089
something that's, you know, I don't know,
let's say you're talking about something.

568
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:53,700
That's got five or six screens
that you're trying to design.

569
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,279
Um, look, I'm easily be
sinking 20, 30, 40 hours into.

570
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:00,525
Which seems like a lot of time.

571
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,134
Um, and some people, they, they
don't want to spend that time.

572
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:08,775
Um, but it really is important for me
to get the work again consistent, um,

573
00:38:08,805 --> 00:38:12,404
to get it to the best out of that I
can and I'm charging for that time.

574
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:14,525
Um, and that's really important as well.

575
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:14,775
Like.

576
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,210
Th th the better work you can do that.

577
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,500
The more attention to detail you can
give you design, um, the more you can

578
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,090
charge for it, the more you'll stand out.

579
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,380
So that's sort of the whole point of
this talk really to make you work better,

580
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,690
um, and make yourself more attractive to
clients to make your work more valuable.

581
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,190
Um, but yeah, look, I do take
the design side seriously.

582
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm not the fastest worker either,
and that's, I have to allow for that.

583
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,710
Um, but I think it's important.

584
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,720
It's not a sort of explaining.

585
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,640
Um, you know, there are some people that,
that kind of, um, try and rush the design

586
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,210
process, or don't have a design process
and now, you know, designers, they go.

587
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:59,310
Um, but even if you're, if you started to
add some design time into your process,

588
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,190
now the time that it saves you is huge.

589
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:07,860
So if I'm working on a, on a large project
or I do design for someone else, um, the

590
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,790
amount of time that that's saving them by
having all of the decisions, um, already

591
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,410
made up, like all the decisions made.

592
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,200
In the design process really is.

593
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,380
Um, yeah, it really is saves
a lot of time in the long run.

594
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,660
Olamide Egbayelo: Alright, thank you.

595
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,480
So, uh, we'll have a
question from the audience.

596
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
We'll have a question from Jenna.

597
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,580
So Jenna is asking, do you have
any go-to resource resources for

598
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,730
things like padding others, struggle
to know how much space to put.

599
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,690
Corey Dodd: Ooh.

600
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,540
So the short answer is no, I don't have
any resources that I use if this is all

601
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:53,279
done by, um, training and, and, um, from
years of experience, uh, as far as things

602
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:59,190
like padding, it's generally more than
what people people allow for currently.

603
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,720
I think a lot of people, um, the
common mistake is real estate.

604
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,210
We always think about real estate and
you know, I've been in the industry.

605
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:07,904
Uh, a long time.

606
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:09,944
And that used to be something that
people would talk about, like how

607
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:14,295
fitting stuff above the fold and
fitting more stuff on the page.

608
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:17,145
Um, but we're used to
scrolling around on websites.

609
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:21,194
We use that stuff all day that, you
know, Instagram and Facebook and all

610
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:22,845
of these apps that just scroll forever.

611
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:26,654
So it's about using the
right amount of space.

612
00:40:26,654 --> 00:40:27,915
So I wouldn't allow more space.

613
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:33,255
It's just about allowing the amount
of space that gives the user a chance

614
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:37,035
to focus on the most important thing
or one, one or two things at a time.

615
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,145
You don't want them distracted.

616
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:40,365
Um, so that's really important.

617
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:43,275
So I don't have any go-to resources.

618
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:47,795
I do treat this on a, um, You
know, project by project basis

619
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:48,965
when I'm, when I'm working on it.

620
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:54,755
So, um, yeah, the only tip I can give
specifically there is to, um, you

621
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:57,605
know, specifically around space is to
give yourself a little bit more space

622
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,075
than, than what you probably think.

623
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:02,345
Olamide Egbayelo: Okay.

624
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,965
Um, thank you, Jenna.

625
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:06,905
I hope, um, Corey has
answered your questions.

626
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:10,655
Uh, remember you can still drop
your questions in the live chat,

627
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:13,775
Corey is here for, to engage.

628
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:17,355
So, uh, I mean, I have
another question for you.

629
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:21,694
Um, so you, you said you don't
have any go-to or resources.

630
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:27,915
I mean, as, as a designer, you
should have, um, most have tools

631
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:33,254
that every designer should have or
should be able to use very well.

632
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:36,555
It could be planning tools,
it could be designed tools.

633
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:39,435
It could be tools that help
you to stay consistent.

634
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:40,845
It could be productivity tools.

635
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:46,535
So can you share some of your,
really, go-to tools with us?

636
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:49,425
Corey Dodd: This is my favorite tool.

637
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:53,355
A bit of paper and some pencil.

638
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:56,715
It sounds really stupid, but,
um, yeah, it's my go to thing.

639
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:57,375
I'd start.

640
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:00,525
Yeah, it doesn't matter if I'm
doing branding or I'm doing,

641
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,995
you know, um, website design.

642
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:07,275
Uh, I can just sketch ideas out
really quickly and often move

643
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:09,555
to all just really rough ideas.

644
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,530
I'm not drawing what a website design
would look like, but I might sort of try

645
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,560
and map out the hierarchy of the content.

646
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,330
So what content I want to go first.

647
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,100
And it's just an easy tool for me.

648
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,860
Um, but as far as the main tools that
I use, uh, I'm a creative cloud person.

649
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,420
I've always been using Adobe.

650
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,040
I don't think that the
tool really matters.

651
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:35,549
It's about the attention to detail
and sort of spending some time.

652
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,089
Um, one thing that I do believe
with Adobe though, as it is

653
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,589
kind of an industry standard.

654
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:44,680
So if you're looking for employment
opportunities and stuff like that, if you,

655
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,970
if you're just going to work for yourself,
it doesn't, it doesn't matter so much.

656
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,740
But if you're going to
want to get employed.

657
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:53,685
So sort of standard tools that you
want to know about these days are

658
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:56,174
obviously the Adobe creative cloud suite.

659
00:42:56,265 --> 00:43:01,725
Um, things like Figma and Sketch are
also pretty important for, um, you

660
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:05,115
know, the web design industry, but
there's a lot of other tools out there

661
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:09,015
that I know people use all the time,
like Canva and that sort of stuff.

662
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,765
Um, at the end of the day, whatever
helps you get your ideas out.

663
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:17,385
It's totally fine, but I am
all of my web design is done in

664
00:43:17,385 --> 00:43:20,115
XD, so I'll use creative cloud.

665
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:25,785
Um, and I like XD purely because it
is a Adobe product and I can move

666
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:28,665
between the programs pretty easily.

667
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:33,915
So if I need to do some illustration work,
I can quickly open up, um, illustrator

668
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:38,565
and start, you know, making up some, some
ideas and then copy that into an XD file.

669
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:39,675
If you're using.

670
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,380
Figma or Sketch you, you
know, it's harder to open up.

671
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,550
Um, th th that's just my personal
preference, but I found it harder to

672
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,720
work without the other creative cloud
pro programs, but I noticed so well.

673
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,390
Olamide Egbayelo: All right.

674
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:54,840
Great.

675
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,710
Thanks for sharing.

676
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,190
We have another question from my audience.

677
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,710
Um, Fernando Eiella is asking
redesigning in the context of keeping

678
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,189
a client sites performant, performant.

679
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:14,775
How does one deal with clients
that want, or need homogeneous

680
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:18,585
videos or pictures on the on page?

681
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:23,295
Corey Dodd: Um, that's a tough question.

682
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:27,945
So I think that as far as like, you know,
optimization and what you're trying to

683
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:33,990
achieve in this design, if something needs
to be fast loading, for instance, That's

684
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,440
a conversation to have pretty early,
um, and really try and address that.

685
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,440
And I know there is the school of
thought that the client's always right.

686
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,110
Um, but then there is the
school of thought that the

687
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,520
client is hiring an expert.

688
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:49,965
So, if you can kind of position
yourself as someone who, um, is an

689
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:55,154
expert and takes less orders, so you
sort of diagnose problems and, and

690
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:56,384
that's the best way to start with that.

691
00:44:56,384 --> 00:45:01,305
So rather than starting relationship
with a client where they're dictating,

692
00:45:01,305 --> 00:45:03,615
what you do, you essentially
say that, what are you going.

693
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:06,225
You're trying to work
out what those goals are.

694
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:12,495
And then when you present design ideas
back to them, you explain how those,

695
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:17,265
um, those design ideas have helped
help the client meet those goals.

696
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:21,975
And then when I have ideas that are
actually not going to help them, that

697
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:26,024
are, that are, that are, I don't want to
say bad ideas, but let's say bad ideas.

698
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:30,045
Um, I explained to them that it
doesn't help them achieve their goals.

699
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:33,315
It's so it's really not about my
personal taste versus the clients.

700
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:39,134
At the end of the day, I don't, I'm
not to design things that I like.

701
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,745
I'm designing things that are going
to work for their customers and

702
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:44,865
help my clients achieve their goals.

703
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:49,214
So if you start with someone's goals,
what they're trying to achieve, um,

704
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:51,375
that's probably the best way to tackle.

705
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,590
Olamide Egbayelo: Oh, awesome.

706
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,960
Um, I hope that's Fernando.

707
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,110
I hope that Corey has been
able to answer your question.

708
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,610
So I know that, um, I still have
another question for you while we

709
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,350
wait for more audience questions.

710
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:14,580
So I know that, um, this session is
what's clearly for designers, people

711
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,129
who are already professional designers
or intermediate or expert designers.

712
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,845
So, um, um, I just want to
put you on the spot here.

713
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,685
What teams do you have for beginners?

714
00:46:26,685 --> 00:46:29,745
Because I know that there are
people who are just taxing or

715
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:34,035
about study design journey and,
um, they have listened to you.

716
00:46:34,035 --> 00:46:36,705
They've watched you speak
about this teams and all that.

717
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:41,565
So can you tell us, can you list about
four to five things that it began

718
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,055
as designers should look, you know,

719
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:49,710
Corey Dodd: I was actually
toying with the idea of speaking

720
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,230
about developing your eye.

721
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,170
And I think that's one of the most
important things with getting better

722
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:00,270
at design or I'm doing good design
is actually, um, one being interested

723
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:04,259
in design and, and seeing seeing
it in the world, you know, noticing

724
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:08,730
what things do you like noticing what
things other people like, and then

725
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,259
trying to work out why they liked them.

726
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,029
And that doesn't need to
be websites all the time.

727
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:17,475
You know how someone likes a pair of
shoes or someone likes a certain car.

728
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:20,805
It's not to your taste, trying to
understand what it is about those

729
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,915
things that, that are appealing
because, because design isn't just

730
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:27,464
about, um, the visual elements.

731
00:47:27,464 --> 00:47:29,895
It's it's about how things
work and how they function.

732
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:33,464
So yeah, developing your
eyes is really important.

733
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:37,004
So keeping up with trends, working
out what stuff looks good to you.

734
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:39,615
And, and so that's number one.

735
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,774
Um, another thing is.

736
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,439
You working out your vocabulary, so
you can actually talk about design

737
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:48,569
and it's, it's a tough thing to do.

738
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:54,390
And, um, it's a skill that a lot
of people, uh, lack, being able

739
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:59,970
to explain their designs in a way
that isn't talking about nonsense.

740
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,100
That's all the fluffy stuff about design.

741
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:03,839
Um, so it's really important.

742
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,160
Like I said, in the other
point about having goals.

743
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,530
And so our tip here is to when
you're taking a design brief with

744
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,260
a client, or you're taking that,
you're doing a discovery session.

745
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,530
For example, if you're asking them
about the things that they like,

746
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,880
um, really keep your ear open and
listen out for the language they use.

747
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,580
So if someone's saying the words, you
know, fun or bold or bright, um, you

748
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,610
might want to slow that down and work
out what that means to them because

749
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,050
someone's idea of fun might be.

750
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,450
More conservative than yours.

751
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,459
So it's working out what they
actually mean because they're

752
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:42,000
subjective terms, but then also
remember the words that they've used.

753
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,029
And then when you talk about.

754
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:45,795
Use the same language.

755
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:48,855
So you presented design back to someone
and say, look, this is really bright.

756
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:50,175
It's really bold and fun.

757
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:51,975
And they go, oh, that's
exactly what I wanted.

758
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,625
And it's just through the language abuse.

759
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:57,195
So that's another tip or what's
another tip for beginners.

760
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,654
Um, just to, just to design for fun.

761
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:02,384
Like when I first started
designing, I would design for fun.

762
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:04,095
I'm not talking about designing for free.

763
00:49:04,335 --> 00:49:07,185
I don't think people should
design for free, but I think

764
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:08,925
they should design for, for fun.

765
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:14,325
So I think, I think if you can design
stuff, um, you know, Play around

766
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:18,495
in the space, even now I'll, I'll
still, you know, I try ideas out.

767
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:25,064
I've been doing this for too long, 20,
over 20 years and I still just try out

768
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:28,214
new ideas just to see where they take me.

769
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,915
Um, and also look at things.

770
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:32,955
And if you see things that are
cool, that's another, that's

771
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:33,794
probably the last thing.

772
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:38,504
If you see things that are really cool,
just create, uh, a memory bank or some

773
00:49:38,504 --> 00:49:39,915
sort of way of capturing images of.

774
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,950
Keep it in a folder of things that you
like, things that you think are fun.

775
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:49,350
Um, I know there's stuff around stealing
ideas, but as far as the idea of, um,

776
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,210
stealing versus inspiration, to me,
the idea of where that crosses the

777
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:59,370
line is if you look at something and
you're directly copying it, um, versus

778
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,370
getting inspired by where that line is.

779
00:50:02,175 --> 00:50:04,935
There's a, there's a thing where if you
steal from one, if you take it from one

780
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,795
source, it's stealing and if you take
from many it's being inspired by it.

781
00:50:08,795 --> 00:50:12,075
So if you have lots of things, if
you're getting, um, your colors from

782
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:15,705
over here and then you're getting, you
know, the topography ideas are from here

783
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:16,965
and you're getting spacing ideas from.

784
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,030
Then you really just being influenced
by a whole lot of stuff, rather

785
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,300
than directly seeing something
you love and trying to copy it.

786
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,370
So keep things that you think are cool.

787
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,810
Keep them in a file.

788
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,380
And just, you know, when you've got a
new project to start and it seems like

789
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,350
something that's fun, maybe you look
at the things that you think are fun.

790
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:37,380
If you've got something that's meant to
be corporate, look at the things that you

791
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,340
think are corporate that are really cool
and try and try and get some inspiration.

792
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:43,950
Olamide Egbayelo: All right.

793
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,090
Thank you so much.

794
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:48,840
Those are really wonderful tips
and talking about inspiration.

795
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,730
We have a question on inspiration.

796
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,130
Okay.

797
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:58,930
So, um, Jenna is asking, where do
you find you find your inspiration?

798
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,410
Corey Dodd: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

799
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,730
So I try to be pretty mindful.

800
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,990
My job has designed and that's what I do.

801
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,120
That's essentially all I get paid to do.

802
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,150
Um, and that's branding websites.

803
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,290
It's all sorts of stuff.

804
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,880
Um, where are trying to get my
inspiration is generally not

805
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,290
from the job that I'm working on.

806
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,560
So if I'm doing a website, I try not to
go look at websites to get inspiration.

807
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,000
I'll try and look in magazines
at, um, you know, brochure,

808
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,440
layouts and stuff like that.

809
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,950
Um, and when I'm doing branding, I like
to look into stuff in the real world.

810
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:32,790
Like if you go out and know.

811
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,340
You know, notice things
on buildings and stuff.

812
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,410
For example, that's always really good.

813
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,090
I'm not the sort of person that opens up
Pinterest and then types in, you know,

814
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,870
whale logo, if I've got a client that
needs, you know, a whale for for a logo.

815
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,230
That's I think that leads
me to a very specific place.

816
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,280
Um, so I try to look at things
that aren't literally what I'm

817
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,300
working on, stuff for me to do.

818
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:58,290
So I'm not gonna sit around and
look up website inspiration.

819
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,920
I don't think there's.

820
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,700
Wrong with doing that, but that's not
where I get my inspiration myself.

821
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:10,000
Um, and we've finding inspiration
specifically, if you've got a website to

822
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,080
do, and let's say it's a fashion website,
you know, there's nothing wrong with

823
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,310
opening up Pinterest and topping and
fashion websites and finding cool ideas.

824
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,830
Um, but I would go back to that constant
concept that I said before, grab, grab

825
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,515
50 ideas that you like, put them in a
folder, look at them, absorb them and

826
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:29,685
then try and come up with something.

827
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:33,884
But look at the things that you like
to understand why you like them.

828
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:37,814
If it's about big type of
graphy, then you know, you want

829
00:52:37,814 --> 00:52:38,895
to work with big topography.

830
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:41,955
If it's about full-size images, et cetera.

831
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:46,004
So rather than grabbing one thing that
you like and copying it, um, yeah.

832
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:47,774
Take a few ideas from a few places.

833
00:52:49,815 --> 00:52:51,375
Olamide Egbayelo: So powerful.

834
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:52,545
That's so powerful.

835
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:53,775
Thank you so much.

836
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:54,415

sharing your design tips with us.

nice having you join us at WordFest Live.

839

00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:12,465

just to say bye to our audience?
