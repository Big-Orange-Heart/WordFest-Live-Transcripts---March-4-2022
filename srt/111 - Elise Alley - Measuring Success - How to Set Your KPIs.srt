34
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,385
Welcome to WordFest
where you are in Africa.

35
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:06,825
And I was part of our 24 hours of
celebrating the people, the technology

36
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:11,355
and the Big Orange Heart of WordPress
WordPress WordFest live is not only

37
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:15,135
delivers a festival educational
content, wellness sessions and

38
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,644
networking opportunities, but it's
also a fundraiser for Big Orange Heart.

39
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:21,674
Please visit that donate link at any time.

40
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:25,035
You'll see it right on the screen there to
support the mission of our organization.

41
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:30,930
WordFest Live is a 24 hour opportunity for
the WordPress community to come together,

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,070
to feel less isolated, learn from one
another and be present with each other.

43
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,840
I am Michelle Frechette.

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,400
I am the director of community
engagement at stellar WP.

45
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,049
I'm also the president of the
board at Big Orange Heart.

46
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:48,154
And so everything that we do here at Big
Orange Heart is very close to my heart.

47
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:51,725
And, um, I just can't say
enough good things about it.

48
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:56,524
The work that we do, uh, has touched my
life as much as anybody else's for sure.

49
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,704
And, uh, it's one of the things
that we do to be able to actually

50
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,234
present something like this.

51
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,415
Uh, we started, uh, during the
beginning part of the pandemic,

52
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:05,225
trying to figure out what.

53
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,519
To reach our community, reduce those
feelings of isolation between us.

54
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,589
And we continue to do that.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,409
Now this is our third iteration
of that, and we're very excited

56
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:17,610
about the work that we're doing.

57
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,099
Our first speaker up today is Elise Alley.

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,950
Uh, her talk is titled measuring success.

59
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,990
How to set your KPIs.

60
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,099
At least Allie is a Texas native
living in Oklahoma and has worked

61
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,510
with WordPress for about 10 years.

62
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,040
Those 10 years have primarily
been spent in support, both as a

63
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,900
support agent and in management.

64
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,780
She's currently a support
manager with stellar WP.

65
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,680
That's where I work.

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,500
So we get, uh, working with companies
like the event teams and cadence WP.

67
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,490
In her free time, Elise enjoys
reading, watching her nephews play

68
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,580
soccer and cuddling with her pets.

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,850
But before we go to that video, let's
hear a quick message from our sponsors.

70
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,180
And then after that, I'll
have a few messages for you.

71
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,620
Elise Alley: No matter what part of
the business you work in your team has

72
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,539
goals to meet in order to be successful.

73
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,700
It's relatively easy to determine whether
or not you've achieved your goals, but

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,409
how do you know you're on the right path?

75
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,969
Hold working towards those goals.

76
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,110
One of the best tools you can use
to measure your success is key

77
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,450
performance indicators or KPIs in
case you are unaware of what they are.

78
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,400
Let's start by defining KPIs..

79
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:39,870
According to KPI dot org key performance
indicators are critical indicators of

80
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,909
progress toward an intended result.

81
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,320
They help us to determine how we are
doing and what we need to improve upon

82
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,510
and to focus on what matters as Peter
Drucker said, what gets measured gets.

83
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,180
Before you start creating your KPIs.

84
00:05:57,299 --> 00:06:00,630
It's essential to remember that
while they are tied together,

85
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:05,940
goals, targets, metrics and KPIs
are not all the same things, though.

86
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,770
The terms are sometimes confused.

87
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,930
Uh, The goal is the end toward
which effort is directed.

88
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,180
Whereas KPIs are the effort that
is directed towards the goal.

89
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,180
A, target is a specific
number you were trying to hit.

90
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,670
For instance, if you want to increase your
revenue by 20%, then 20% is your target.

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,830
KPIs and metrics are very intertwined.

92
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,930
A metric is a standard of measurement.

93
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,080
Whenever you measure
anything, that is a metric.

94
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,890
Uh, KPI is actually a type of
metric, but one specifically

95
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,480
used to measure performance.

96
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,710
It is also something that has been
defined as necessary or important

97
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,910
Confusing or combining these terms
can create problems as it does

98
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,600
not allow for goals that need to
be measured by more than one KPI

99
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,640
or where the goal is intangible.

100
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,870
So it is better to treat
them as distinct terms.

101
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,750
In situations where the goal is
intangible instead of using a direct

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,020
measure, you would use several
indirect measures, which are sometimes

103
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,730
referred to as proxy measures.

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,630
For example, say our goal was to
improve employee satisfaction,

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,370
a slightly intangible goal.

106
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,700
You would likely need to use several
indirect measures, such as the

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,720
results from an employee engagement
survey and the average turnover rate.

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,090
You could structure your goal, KPIs
and targets, something like this.

109
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:40,755
Your first KPI, maybe something like
employees say they are satisfied in

110
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,885
the role sitting at target of 90%.

111
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,474
Another KPI could be something like
employees say they see a long time

112
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,784
future here with the target of 80%.

113
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:53,085
And your last KPI may be something
like average turnover rate

114
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,245
with a target of less than 5%.

115
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:03,594
By considering these terms separately,
we aren't forced into deciding.

116
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,140
All at the same time, we
can start off with a goal.

117
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,510
Then use KPIs and targets to pin down
how we are going to define success and

118
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,190
measure our progress towards that goal.

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
Developing a good KPI takes
time and developing good

120
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,010
targets can take even longer

121
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,810
Goals, however, are comparatively easy to
create because they are just describing

122
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,370
something that you want to happen.

123
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,179
So now that we know what
KPIs are and aren't.

124
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,140
Let's look at what it takes to create
your KPIs, depending on your business team

125
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,280
or role, there are potentially limitless
numbers of KPIs you could choose from.

126
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,459
So choosing the right KPIs
can be a daunting task

127
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,130
to start creating your KPIs.

128
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,400
You will need to start by
creating your goals again while

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,930
goals and KPIs are different.

130
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,189
They're not totally separate.

131
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,840
You need to know your goals
in order to create your KPI.

132
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,444
Creating your goals is the what and
the why, what do you want to achieve?

133
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,675
And why do you want achieve that?

134
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:07,244
You should remember that poor
non-specific goals, make it more

135
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:11,265
difficult for your colleagues to
set good tactical goals and KPIs.

136
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,295
Once you have set your goals, the
next step is determine how you

137
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,704
were going to reach those goals.

138
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,444
And that is where KPIs come in.

139
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:26,165
An excellent way to get started
on creating your KPI is to

140
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,524
reverse engineer your goal.

141
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,080
So what makes a good KPI?

142
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,000
The term you'll often hear when
researching KPIs is the acronym SMART,

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,140
SMART stands for specific measurable,
attainable, relevant, and time-bound

144
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,730
a good KPI, should be obvious as to
what it is specifically that you were

145
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,410
measuring and why it is important.

146
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
It should also be measurable so
that you can determine whether

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,990
you were successfully moving
towards your goal or not.

148
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,400
A smart KPI is also attainable.

149
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,010
While it's always good to set high goals.

150
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,260
It is important that it's something that
you can achieve and deliver on because

151
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,480
KPIs are used to achieve your goals.

152
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,840
Obviously they should be
relevant to those goals as well.

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,430
Sometimes they are in smart stands
for realistic, instead of relevant.

154
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,470
If you're using that option, you'd
probably ask your self a question, like

155
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,390
is our measure practical and pragmatic?

156
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:29,715
And it should be time bound, meaning you
have a set deadline to achieve your goal.

157
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,645
At which point you can reevaluate
and create new goals and KPIs.

158
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,345
Well, this is a great starting point.

159
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:44,175
The smart acronym has been extended
by some from just smart to smart ass.

160
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:48,945
The smart and smart ass frameworks can
be used when creating goals and KPIs.

161
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,640
The additional three letters for
this method may apply better when

162
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,060
creating goals, but are helpful
when creating KPIs as well.

163
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,730
The additional three letters stand for
adaptable, social, and systems-based,

164
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,900
you should be able to change and
adapt your KPIs and to review them.

165
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,680
If they aren't helping you to reach
your goal, you need to adjust.

166
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,580
You should not be keeping
your KPIs to yourself.

167
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:19,365
You need to work with others on your team
when creating your KPIs as well as making

168
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:25,215
sure your team has continued access to
your KPIs, your goals and KPIs should

169
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,825
also fit with your other goals and KPIs

170
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,215
Will failing one of your
goals affect your other goal?

171
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:34,215
If so, then you need
to make an adjustment.

172
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,825
Be intentional when
you're creating your KPIs.

173
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,520
It is better to have a few meaningful KPIs
rather than a bunch of metrics that are

174
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,530
unimportant or difficult to understand.

175
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,250
You will want to start by
considering direct measurements.

176
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,800
If you want to increase revenue, the
total revenue by month or year would be

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,220
an example of a direct measurement, but
some things can't be measured directly.

178
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,730
For example, if you want to
measure something more intangible,

179
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,380
like customer satisfaction.

180
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,670
You could use indirect measures,
such as C-SAT surveys, average

181
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,530
return rate or repurchase rate.

182
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,870
If you're using indirect KPIs,
it is safer to use more than one.

183
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,250
You should also be careful that
you don't use bad proxy measures.

184
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,070
Talk to your team while
you're creating your KPIs.

185
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,110
It is better to work with others,
to create the KPIs than it is to

186
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,610
be halfway through your project.

187
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,180
Only to have someone ask if those
measurements are really effective,

188
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,570
KPIs do not have to be perfect, but
they do need to command the confidence

189
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,890
of everyone who will be using them.

190
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,040
Creating buy-in for your KPIs is time.

191
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,920
You need to invest at the start,
but it's also time well spent.

192
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,010
Again, goals can be used on
multiple levels within your company.

193
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,730
You can have different goals and KPIs
set for your business as a whole.

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,290
And then each of the individual teams,
common company goals include revenue,

195
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,980
growth, profit margin increase,
and customer growth and retention.

196
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,360
When you are setting strategic company
goals, you should be able to explain

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,220
how that supports the company's mission.

198
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,670
With customer retention.

199
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,540
For example, your goal may be to
maintain a 75% retention rate.

200
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,060
Your target would be 75% and one of
your KPIs might be customer turn rate.

201
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,750
Instead of focusing on overall
company goals, you might be

202
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,490
focusing on your individual team.

203
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,210
When setting goals for your
individual teams, they should

204
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,200
support the overall company strategy
for your customer support team.

205
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,490
You might set a goal as customer
satisfaction or retention for marketing.

206
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,500
It might be increasing organic search
growth for organic search growth.

207
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,520
Your KPIs could include something like
the number of customers you acquire

208
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,620
through organic growth month over month.

209
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,574
So let's take a look at a couple of
examples of smart KPIs for different teams

210
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,125
for your customer service or support team.

211
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:20,115
You might use KPIs like first
response time resolution rate,

212
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:24,455
and customer satisfaction ratings
using customer surveys or C-SAP.

213
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,795
For your customer service or support
team, you might use KPIs like first

214
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:35,025
response, time resolution rate, and
customer satisfaction ratings using

215
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,974
something like customer surveys or SEASET

216
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:45,704
your project management KPIs might
include things like on time completion,

217
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:50,605
percentages, milestones on time
percentages and budget variances.

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,760
Your marketing team might use KPIs like
new customers, upsell and cross-sell rates

219
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,650
and social media return on investment.

220
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,480
When creating your KPIs, you should
also be aware of two different types

221
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,510
of indicators lagging and leading.

222
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,650
So what's the difference between
lagging and leading indicator.

223
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,150
A lagging indicator
measures past performance.

224
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,990
Whereas a leading indicator is a
predictive measure of future performance.

225
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,400
Generally, we are most interested
in a lagging indicators.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,220
However, if those lagging indicators
take a long time to materialize,

227
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,210
maybe something like revenue per
quarter, then it's a good idea to

228
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,370
track leading indicators as well.

229
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,140
That way you can make
better decisions day-to-day.

230
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,005
To look at a short example.

231
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:55,035
If you're measuring your cashflow
payments received would be an

232
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,745
example of a lagging indicator.

233
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,204
It measures what has already happened.

234
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:03,584
Whereas invoices issued would be
an example of a leading indicator

235
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:07,694
because it measures the cash you are
likely to receive in the near future.

236
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,084
It is only predictive because
it's not guaranteed that everyone

237
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,964
will pay or even pay on time.

238
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:18,074
A longer-term example of leading and
lagging indicators might be share of

239
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:22,844
market or share of voice share of market
measures, the percentage of revenue you

240
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:26,535
were responsible for within the whole
market compared to your competitors.

241
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:30,885
It's a lagging indicator, whereas
share a voice measures the percentage

242
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:36,104
of your brands media spend within the
market compared to your competitors.

243
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:41,280
And the excess share of voice compared to
your share of market is predictive of any

244
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,979
increase share of market in the future.

245
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,300
It's a leading indicator

246
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,630
along with lagging and leading
indicators, you also have qualitative

247
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,699
and quantitative indicators.

248
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:59,780
Quantitative indicators are
the most straightforward KPIs.

249
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,449
Basically they are measured
solely by a number.

250
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,905
There are two types of quantitative
indicators, continuous and discrete.

251
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:14,065
Whereas qualitative indicators
are not measured by numbers.

252
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:17,155
Typically a qualitative KPI
is a characteristic of a

253
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:18,954
process or business decision.

254
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:25,985
Again, quantitative KPIs are represented
by numbers and include things like

255
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:29,015
sales growth, customer lifetime value.

256
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,825
Number of resolve tickets,
customer acquisition costs.

257
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,110
Monthly recurring revenue
and service response time.

258
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,670
Qualitative KPIs, however
are not measured by number.

259
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,510
Therefore they are often thought
of as more difficult to gather.

260
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,250
Some ways to gather the qualitative
KPIs is through customer feedback,

261
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,290
anecdotes, stories, comments,
and responses to surveys.

262
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:07,325
Beyond leading lagging qualitative and
quantitative indicators, there are a

263
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,545
number of other indicators as well.

264
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:18,495
There are input indicators which are
used to measure resources needed for

265
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,014
a process or project and includes
things like equipment required.

266
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,590
Process indicators are meant to
measure the performance of a process

267
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,230
and facilitate any necessary changes.

268
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,930
Things like tickets resolved, tickets
opened and resolution times fall under

269
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,500
process indicators as they can tell
you how your support team is doing.

270
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,780
Output indicators, measure the success or
failure of a process, and are probably the

271
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,970
most commonly used KPI type and include
revenue, profits, and new customers.

272
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,945
Practical indicators measure the effect
of a process used by a business and

273
00:18:57,945 --> 00:19:00,225
are typically unique to your business.

274
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:05,095
Directional indicators look
at trends within your company.

275
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:07,495
Where are the metrics moving?

276
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:08,455
Are they improving?

277
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:10,165
Declining, maintaining.

278
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:15,485
Actionable indicators measure the
effectiveness in implementing business

279
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,825
changes, including things like processes.

280
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,760
And lastly, financial indicators
measure economic stability,

281
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,380
growth and business viability.

282
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,560
These KPIs are things like gross profit
margin, net profit and asset ratios.

283
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,040
They typically provide the most
straightforward insight into the

284
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,450
financial health of a company, but they
are usually best paired with other KPIs

285
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,260
in order to provide a full picture.

286
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,530
When creating your KPIs, there are a
lot of things you need to make sure

287
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,550
to remember to do, but there are also
some things you want to avoid as well.

288
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,130
The first thing you want to
avoid is bad proxy measures.

289
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,600
As mentioned earlier.

290
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,870
Sometimes there are things we want
to measure, but are either difficult

291
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,120
to measure or are intangible.

292
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,930
In those situations we may
measure a KPI we think is related,

293
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,520
and this is a proxy measure.

294
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,070
It's not bad to use proxy
measures, but it is easy to use

295
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,840
bad ones if you aren't careful.

296
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,550
For instance, an increase in social
media followers does not necessarily

297
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,500
increase positive brand sentiment.

298
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,240
KPIs should be measured by performance,
not activity, making a KPI like post

299
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,700
five social media post, for example, is
measuring activity, but creating a post

300
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,490
with 5,000 impressions is performance.

301
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:47,595
You want to make sure that you avoid
using weasel words, weasel words are words

302
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:52,814
that are ambiguous words like effective,
optimize, streamline, and so on.

303
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,925
They make it sound important,
but they aren't measurable and

304
00:20:56,925 --> 00:21:00,884
therefore should be avoided when
creating your KPIs, and your goals.

305
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,100
You also need to make sure you're
sharing your KPIs with your team, as it

306
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,510
tells your team what is important and
should be inspiring them into action.

307
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,580
You also want to make sure you
don't forget to review your KPIs.

308
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,930
Unfortunately, so many people go
through the long and sometimes tedious

309
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,950
process of developing KPIs, but then
don't look at them until the end of

310
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,800
the year or until the project is over.

311
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,220
By tracking KPIs and keeping them
visible, you can continually spark action

312
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,780
and focusing attention of your team.

313
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,270
As mentioned previously, it is very
important to keep your KPIs visible

314
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,949
and to be able to track them easily.

315
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,360
An excellent way to do that
is to use a KPI dashboard.

316
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:49,820
A KPI dashboard provides management a
platform for monitoring and analyzing.

317
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,660
It allows companies to track the
performance of individuals, departments,

318
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,120
teams, or even the entire company.

319
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,100
Dashboards enable management to see
trends quickly and can be alerted to the

320
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,920
KPIs that have exceeded set thresholds.

321
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,710
You can create your own dashboard or you
can use one of the many existing options

322
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,590
such as Domo, good data and power BI.

323
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,720
You might also already use a platform
that includes this type of dashboard.

324
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,230
For instance, if you're using a support
platform like Zendesk, Salesforce, or

325
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,750
live agent, they all include dashboards.

326
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,020
If you decide to create your
own KPI dashboard, here are a

327
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,129
couple of things to remember.

328
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,629
You want to keep it since.

329
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:46,155
Limit the number of KPIs to a single
screen for specific objective project

330
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:49,905
or department overlooking cause
users to miss vital information.

331
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:55,035
You should show a trend over time
because, for a graph or data to really

332
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:57,555
be useful, it needs context and history.

333
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:00,915
You want to tell a story
with your dashboard.

334
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:04,365
Any graphical interpretation
is best understood if it's

335
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,765
in the context of the story.

336
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:10,445
Overpowering color schemes
can cause your dashboard to be

337
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:14,885
illegible, pick a clean and simple
color palette for your dashboard.

338
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:22,665
When you're creating your dashboard,
you want to keep in mind the

339
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:24,165
type of dashboard that you need.

340
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,814
Strategic dashboards are mostly used
to view the business as a whole.

341
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,364
They are a great way to see
the company's current status.

342
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:36,270
Operation dashboards are typically
used by managers and employees

343
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,560
and provide real-time data.

344
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:41,550
Analytical dashboards are
used for investigation of any

345
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,350
unexpected anomalies and data.

346
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,250
They are sometimes called KPI
reports in our tool to determine

347
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,780
the cause of any fluctuations.

348
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:01,310
Another step we emphasized not to
skip is reviewing your KPIs regulary.

349
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,669
Click.com has outlined an
excellent KPI iteration process.

350
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:09,570
First, you want to make sure
you schedule a recurring cycle.

351
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,730
You'll want to create a schedule based on
your own business and your business needs.

352
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,730
When reviewing your KPIs, make sure you're
asking the right questions such as what

353
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,449
trends or changes am I saying, are any
of these KPIs underperforming, and so on.

354
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:30,600
After you've reviewed and questioned
your current KPIs, the next step is to

355
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,680
make any updates to them and then make
sure everyone knows of the changes.

356
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,360
As we learned today, there are
many types of KPIs you can use.

357
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,650
Because it's a measurement, the natural
assumption is that KPIs should always

358
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,720
be a number, something we can count.

359
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,770
However, evaluation particularly
of service and customer

360
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,090
experience often go beyond.

361
00:24:55,525 --> 00:25:00,505
To get a true, complete picture
of your business, past present,

362
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:04,135
and future, understanding all
the types of KPIs as essential.

363
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:09,265
Each one provides valuable insight that
can inform strategic decision-making

364
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,405
and business development.

365
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:17,735
So when you walk away from
this session today, there are a

366
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:18,605
couple of things you should know.

367
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,600
First goals, KPIs, targets and
metrics are not all the same thing.

368
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,530
And when creating your KPIs, remember
to start with your goals, keep your

369
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,050
KPIs smart, or maybe even smart
ass, evaluate them often and make

370
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,340
sure to share them with your team.

371
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,270
Thank you for joining me today
to learn more about KPI's.

372
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,090
Dan Maby: How you doing Elise?

373
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,429
Thank you so much for your session today.

374
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,590
Thank you sharing it with us.

375
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,899
Elise Alley: Thank you.

376
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:49,670
Thank you for having me.

377
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,190
Michelle Frechette: Absolutely.

378
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,920
I, um, I just want to say you
are a smart ass was kick ass.

379
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,520
Absolutely.

380
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,680
I'm just going to check.

381
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,580
I don't think we had any questions come
in from the chat at all, but I know

382
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,159
Dan and I probably have a few for you.

383
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:17,475
Um, I have the pleasure of getting to
work with Elise and so I've, um, but we

384
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,625
have never talked about, we don't have the
same team and we have not talked about,

385
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:23,205
um, you know, KPIs and things like that.

386
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:27,795
But when I hear acronyms like that,
like KPIs and measurements, I know

387
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,345
that there are some people that
those are triggering things, right?

388
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:31,425
Like it's a scary thing.

389
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,814
When you start to talk about what you're
responsible for those kinds of things.

390
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,415
What are some ways that you
can think of that can kind

391
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:40,995
of take the stress out of it?

392
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,524
Maybe game-ify it.

393
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:46,095
Um, and have fun with meeting goals?

394
00:26:47,685 --> 00:26:48,195
Elise Alley: Sure.

395
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:54,330
Um, it's not something it's
not something, a stressor that

396
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,710
I've really come across before.

397
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,320
If for me, it's, you know, we have a goal.

398
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,330
And so it's the question
of how do we achieve it?

399
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,790
And that's what KPI KPIs are.

400
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,240
So, you know, getting away
from the initials and all of

401
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,580
that, that can be intimidating.

402
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,680
It's just, what do we want to do?

403
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,210
Where do we want to go?

404
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,070
How do we achieve these things?

405
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:17,295
And, uh, finding ways to do that.

406
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:21,465
And, you know, so working with our
teams to finding different ways to

407
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:22,995
complete the things that we need to do.

408
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,145
Michelle Frechette: Yeah,
that makes perfect sense.

409
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:31,425
Um, what I was working at give WP,
sometimes we would, um, set different

410
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:36,105
goals to kind of outside of our
normal, regular KPI type structure of

411
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:40,155
like, let's have a contest to see who
can get the most five star reviews

412
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,865
this month, those kinds of things.

413
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:44,745
What do you think about using
some of those incentives to

414
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:46,605
help move the team forward?

415
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,625
Um, and, uh, you know, adding a
little bit of gamification just

416
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,905
to keep things insteresting.

417
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:53,155
Elise Alley: Sure.

418
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:57,540
It's always fun when you get a
chance to, to compete with people.

419
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,650
Some of us are more competitive
than others, uh, myself included.

420
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,250
So, um, it never hurts to game-ify things.

421
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,950
We, you know, I work primarily in
support and our goal is always to help

422
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,570
our customers and make them happy.

423
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,410
Um, so we do little things like we
do, you know, make sure that we're

424
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,890
reading positive reviews, not just
for ourselves, but I make sure in

425
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,340
our support meetings that I'm reading
positive reviews from customers.

426
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,900
I, um, my support supervisor sends out
a newsletter every month that has like

427
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,550
positive reviews and that sort of thing.

428
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:38,070
So, uh, not necessarily gamifying,
but I want to highlight what an

429
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,050
awesome job our team is doing.

430
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,925
Um, And so making sure everyone else
sees that, and they're getting positive

431
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:48,135
feedback, not just from customers, but
then they hear back from the rest of

432
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:52,995
the team who doesn't always see what's
going on in support um, but they get to

433
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:56,895
hear, you know, from our developers and
stuff saying what an awesome job they're

434
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:58,315
doing as well, when they read those.

435
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:03,060
Dan Maby: Elise I think the KPIs
are, you know, they're, they're

436
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,760
incredibly important for business
development, business growth, you

437
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,940
know, expansion and, um, you know,
understanding where the business is.

438
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,420
But I think what would your, what
would your thoughts be around, uh, when

439
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,920
you're dealing with a smaller business?

440
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,430
So a solo in a, you know, a solo
business owner and individual that,

441
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,830
uh, maybe a freelancer, I, from
some of the conversations that I've

442
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,160
certainly had with freelancers, you
get into this idea of KPIs and itself

443
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,625
to become a bit, scary, a bit kind of
corporate  do you have any advice for

444
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,075
that kind of, that kind of demographic.

445
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:37,815
Elise Alley: Um, I think, you know,
it's similar to, to what I said before,

446
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:42,245
whatever, you know, whether you work for
a larger business or for yourself, you

447
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:46,905
have some sort of goal, uh, maybe as a
freelancer it's to no longer work for,

448
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:52,920
you know, this nine to five company and
to go out on your own, um, So, whether you

449
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,660
call that a goal or a dream, or however
you phrase it, that's still a goal, which

450
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,430
means there are action steps that you can
take and can measure to get to that point.

451
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,740
Um, so, you know, maybe it's
having X number of clients.

452
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,400
Um, once I hit this point and I'm
bringing in this amount of money, then I

453
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,160
can walk away from my nine to five job.

454
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:20,850
Again, no matter what size
company you are on your own or, or

455
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,649
however, it may be, you have goals.

456
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:26,210
And these KPIs are just
action steps to get there.

457
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,825
Dan Maby: Absolutely I did.

458
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,585
There was a comment coming
from the chat there.

459
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:36,525
Wouldn't this wouldn't that add
stress to the regular work stress,

460
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,985
Elise Alley: but I'll be honest.

461
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:42,215
I.

462
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,885
I love where I work.

463
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:47,274
I have no ambitions to go out on my own.

464
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:51,564
So, um, that is definitely not an
additional stress I would want to add,

465
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:55,945
but I do know people that really want
to work for themselves and so sometimes

466
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:59,455
you've got to balance both of those
stresses and it's not a lot of fun for

467
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:02,754
awhile, but if it gets you to where
you want to be, then it's worth it.

468
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:04,635
Dan Maby: Yeah.

469
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:07,965
I mean, I think the old, then you
can go back to the old kind of

470
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,965
adage of, you know, if you, if
you don't plan, you plan to fail.

471
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:11,284
Right.

472
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:16,365
Sort of, and actually know how do you,
as a, as a, as an individual, as a

473
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:21,284
freelancer or a remote worker that is
maybe potentially isolated and you're

474
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:24,885
working on their own, um, it can be
quite difficult sometimes getting

475
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,415
out of your own head and how do you.

476
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,915
Work out where the business is
going, or what, what direction do

477
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:32,295
you want to take your career in?

478
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:35,175
Um, and I think it all relates
back to what you're talking about

479
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:37,485
here in terms of the kind of
goal setting and understanding.

480
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:37,815
Elise Alley: Yes.

481
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:43,705
And also, you know, I mentioned that, you
know, being social, so with the pandemic

482
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:47,655
and everything maybe that limits it
some, but whether it's on phone calls or

483
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:52,005
slack chats or whatever it is, talk about
your goals with somebody else, they can

484
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:55,005
help you narrow down what that goal is.

485
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:58,605
They can help you figure out
what those steps need to be.

486
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:02,655
Um, so don't be afraid to share and
get other people involved, even if

487
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:06,075
you're working for yourself, you've
got friends and family who are going

488
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:09,795
to support your dream and can help
you work through the things that

489
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,175
you need to, to accomplish that.

490
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,400
Dan Maby: Absolutely just out of interest.

491
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,300
And they're just another question.

492
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,735
Do you, do you, um, You don't
necessarily do answer this, but

493
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:25,995
just the question around, do you
set KPIs within your personal life?

494
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:27,795
Is that something that you apply across?

495
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,365
Elise Alley: I do not.

496
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:35,295
It is something I, um, when I first
became a support supervisor for I

497
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:39,195
themes, uh, we didn't really, we
had never had a support supervisor.

498
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:40,995
We had never had KPIs.

499
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:45,135
Um, so I was basically, I'd been
with the team for a long time, but it

500
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,815
was basically starting from scratch.

501
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,195
Um, and so.

502
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,770
What are the first things I did was
create goals and KPIs, um, and have

503
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,680
worked with, you know, the other
teams and stuff and helped people

504
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,420
create KPIs and stuff as well.

505
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,630
So it's not something I do
outside of work, but have,

506
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,670
have done quite a bit inside.

507
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,905
Michelle Frechette: Oh, it is
the middle of the night for you.

508
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:12,014
And we appreciate you coming on
to do a live Q and a with us.

509
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:13,125
Um, talk.

510
00:33:13,544 --> 00:33:14,205
It was a great talk.

511
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:19,455
And I think that, um, you know, definitely
is what I'll be glad as on the, um, you

512
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,865
know, at our library of talks for, for
future reference for other people as well.

513
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:25,135
Great.

514
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,334
Thank you so much, Elise.

515
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,165
I also want to thank
our sponsors Bluehost.

You might even win some prizes.

519
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:40,855
There's some, uh, wheels
you can spin for prizes.

520
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:44,455
I actually won something from
Nexcess, uh, and we work there.

521
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,764
So I don't know how that's gonna
work, but we'll figure it out.

522
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:50,064
I'll send it over to the photo.

523
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:54,185
Our photo booth is sponsored by
multicolor lab and dream host.

524
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,745
And those are so much fun.

525
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,125
Dan, you did a great job
building the photo booth out.

526
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,785
I've already tweeted out a
couple of photos of myself.

527
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:02,315
Um, no Tiara this year.

528
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:10,560
We also, I think I have one of the other
room, maybe I'll maybe I'll fill it out.

529
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,239
We also want to thank our media
partners and our micro sponsors in the

530
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,060
community tent within the next hour
of Cloudways will have their hourly

531
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,549
giveaway and the special guests activity.

532
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:21,389
And WeGlot ahead.

00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:24,605
Well I'm here, Nando joining
them at their session.

534
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,455
How could you be part of the five
for the future movement right now?

535
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,435
We would love your support.

536
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,114
Dan, tell him there's a button, right?

537
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:31,834
Where's the button?

538
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:32,794
Dan Maby: There is a button.

539
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:33,185
There's a button.

540
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:37,504

the menu on the left-hand side there,

541
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:39,214

00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:43,534

00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:58,029
And the word, WordFest is open to all.

548
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,600
So if you've got a colleague, a
friend, somebody who's not, you're

549
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,710
not seeing in the community sent.

550
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:05,085
I think of a message

551
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:06,045
Michelle Frechette: drag.

552
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:10,935
Drag them in the in
it's worth it for sure.

553
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:12,045
At least I hope you could.

554
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,265
I know it's late, but I hope you
could spend a few minutes in the

555
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:16,965
community tent saying hello to people.

556
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,215
We will be back on the hour.

557
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:22,215
We have a little bit of time head over
to the community tent, meet some people.

558
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:26,725
Um, on the hour we will be doing a
live interview with Topher DeRosia.

559
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:28,175
One of our organizers.

560
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,839
And, uh, just continuing on after
that with a whole bunch of fun stuff,

561
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,759
including one of our sponsor interviews
with, uh, probably gonna just destroy

562
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:42,049
his name, but Taco Verdonschot of Yoast.

563
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,230
He'll correct me later if I'm
wrong, but we'll, uh, we'll

564
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,910
see everybody back on the hour.

565
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,770
