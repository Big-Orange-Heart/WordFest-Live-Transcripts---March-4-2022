Welcome to WordFest
where you are in Africa.

35
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:39,238
And I was part of our 24 hours of
celebrating the people, the technology

36
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:43,768
and the Big Orange Heart of WordPress
WordPress WordFest live is not only

37
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:47,548
delivers a festival educational
content, wellness sessions and

38
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:51,058
networking opportunities, but it's
also a fundraiser for Big Orange Heart.

39
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:54,088
Please visit that donate link at any time.

40
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:57,448
You'll see it right on the screen there to
support the mission of our organization.

41
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:03,343
WordFest Live is a 24 hour opportunity for
the WordPress community to come together,

42
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:07,483
to feel less isolated, learn from one
another and be present with each other.

43
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,253
I am Michelle Frechette.

44
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:13,813
I am the director of community
engagement at stellar WP.

45
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,463
I'm also the president of the
board at Big Orange Heart.

46
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:20,568
And so everything that we do here at Big
Orange Heart is very close to my heart.

47
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:24,138
And, um, I just can't say
enough good things about it.

48
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,938
The work that we do, uh, has touched my
life as much as anybody else's for sure.

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,118
And, uh, it's one of the things
that we do to be able to actually

50
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:33,648
present something like this.

51
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,828
Uh, we started, uh, during the
beginning part of the pandemic,

52
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:37,638
trying to figure out what.

53
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:43,933
To reach our community, reduce those
feelings of isolation between us.

54
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,003
And we continue to do that.

55
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,823
Now this is our third iteration
of that, and we're very excited

56
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,023
about the work that we're doing.

57
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,513
Our first speaker up today is Elise Alley.

58
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:58,363
Uh, her talk is titled measuring success.

59
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,403
How to set your KPIs.

60
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:04,513
At least Allie is a Texas native
living in Oklahoma and has worked

61
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:05,923
with WordPress for about 10 years.

62
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:10,453
Those 10 years have primarily
been spent in support, both as a

63
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,313
support agent and in management.

64
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,193
She's currently a support
manager with stellar WP.

65
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:16,093
That's where I work.

66
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:21,913
So we get, uh, working with companies
like the event teams and cadence WP.

67
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:25,903
In her free time, Elise enjoys
reading, watching her nephews play

68
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:27,993
soccer and cuddling with her pets.

69
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:32,263
But before we go to that video, let's
hear a quick message from our sponsors.

70
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,593
And then after that, I'll
have a few messages for you.

71
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,033
Elise Alley: No matter what part of
the business you work in your team has

72
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,953
goals to meet in order to be successful.

73
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:46,113
It's relatively easy to determine whether
or not you've achieved your goals, but

74
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,823
how do you know you're on the right path?

75
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,383
Hold working towards those goals.

76
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:56,523
One of the best tools you can use
to measure your success is key

77
00:04:56,523 --> 00:05:01,863
performance indicators or KPIs in
case you are unaware of what they are.

78
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,813
Let's start by defining KPIs..

79
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:12,283
According to KPI dot org key performance
indicators are critical indicators of

80
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,323
progress toward an intended result.

81
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:18,733
They help us to determine how we are
doing and what we need to improve upon

82
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:23,923
and to focus on what matters as Peter
Drucker said, what gets measured gets.

83
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,593
Before you start creating your KPIs.

84
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:33,043
It's essential to remember that
while they are tied together,

85
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:38,353
goals, targets, metrics and KPIs
are not all the same things, though.

86
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,183
The terms are sometimes confused.

87
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:46,343
Uh, The goal is the end toward
which effort is directed.

88
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:49,593
Whereas KPIs are the effort that
is directed towards the goal.

89
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,593
A, target is a specific
number you were trying to hit.

90
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:02,083
For instance, if you want to increase your
revenue by 20%, then 20% is your target.

91
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,243
KPIs and metrics are very intertwined.

92
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,343
A metric is a standard of measurement.

93
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,493
Whenever you measure
anything, that is a metric.

94
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:19,303
Uh, KPI is actually a type of
metric, but one specifically

95
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:20,893
used to measure performance.

96
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,123
It is also something that has been
defined as necessary or important

97
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,323
Confusing or combining these terms
can create problems as it does

98
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:36,013
not allow for goals that need to
be measured by more than one KPI

99
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,053
or where the goal is intangible.

100
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,283
So it is better to treat
them as distinct terms.

101
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:45,163
In situations where the goal is
intangible instead of using a direct

102
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:48,433
measure, you would use several
indirect measures, which are sometimes

103
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,143
referred to as proxy measures.

104
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,043
For example, say our goal was to
improve employee satisfaction,

105
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,783
a slightly intangible goal.

106
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,113
You would likely need to use several
indirect measures, such as the

107
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:03,133
results from an employee engagement
survey and the average turnover rate.

108
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:08,503
You could structure your goal, KPIs
and targets, something like this.

109
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,168
Your first KPI, maybe something like
employees say they are satisfied in

110
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:15,298
the role sitting at target of 90%.

111
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:19,888
Another KPI could be something like
employees say they see a long time

112
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,198
future here with the target of 80%.

113
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,498
And your last KPI may be something
like average turnover rate

114
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,658
with a target of less than 5%.

115
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:36,008
By considering these terms separately,
we aren't forced into deciding.

116
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,553
All at the same time, we
can start off with a goal.

117
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,923
Then use KPIs and targets to pin down
how we are going to define success and

118
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,603
measure our progress towards that goal.

119
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,893
Developing a good KPI takes
time and developing good

120
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,423
targets can take even longer

121
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:57,223
Goals, however, are comparatively easy to
create because they are just describing

122
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,783
something that you want to happen.

123
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,593
So now that we know what
KPIs are and aren't.

124
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:09,553
Let's look at what it takes to create
your KPIs, depending on your business team

125
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:13,693
or role, there are potentially limitless
numbers of KPIs you could choose from.

126
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:16,873
So choosing the right KPIs
can be a daunting task

127
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,543
to start creating your KPIs.

128
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:25,813
You will need to start by
creating your goals again while

129
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,343
goals and KPIs are different.

130
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:28,603
They're not totally separate.

131
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,253
You need to know your goals
in order to create your KPI.

132
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,858
Creating your goals is the what and
the why, what do you want to achieve?

133
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,088
And why do you want achieve that?

134
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,658
You should remember that poor
non-specific goals, make it more

135
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,678
difficult for your colleagues to
set good tactical goals and KPIs.

136
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:51,708
Once you have set your goals, the
next step is determine how you

137
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,118
were going to reach those goals.

138
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,858
And that is where KPIs come in.

139
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:58,578
An excellent way to get started
on creating your KPI is to

140
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,938
reverse engineer your goal.

141
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,493
So what makes a good KPI?

142
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:08,413
The term you'll often hear when
researching KPIs is the acronym SMART,

143
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:15,553
SMART stands for specific measurable,
attainable, relevant, and time-bound

144
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:20,143
a good KPI, should be obvious as to
what it is specifically that you were

145
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,823
measuring and why it is important.

146
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,973
It should also be measurable so
that you can determine whether

147
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,403
you were successfully moving
towards your goal or not.

148
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,813
A smart KPI is also attainable.

149
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,423
While it's always good to set high goals.

150
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:39,673
It is important that it's something that
you can achieve and deliver on because

151
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,893
KPIs are used to achieve your goals.

152
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:45,253
Obviously they should be
relevant to those goals as well.

153
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:49,843
Sometimes they are in smart stands
for realistic, instead of relevant.

154
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:54,883
If you're using that option, you'd
probably ask your self a question, like

155
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,803
is our measure practical and pragmatic?

156
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:02,128
And it should be time bound, meaning you
have a set deadline to achieve your goal.

157
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:06,058
At which point you can reevaluate
and create new goals and KPIs.

158
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,758
Well, this is a great starting point.

159
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:16,588
The smart acronym has been extended
by some from just smart to smart ass.

160
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:21,358
The smart and smart ass frameworks can
be used when creating goals and KPIs.

161
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:26,053
The additional three letters for
this method may apply better when

162
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,473
creating goals, but are helpful
when creating KPIs as well.

163
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:35,143
The additional three letters stand for
adaptable, social, and systems-based,

164
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:39,313
you should be able to change and
adapt your KPIs and to review them.

165
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,093
If they aren't helping you to reach
your goal, you need to adjust.

166
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,993
You should not be keeping
your KPIs to yourself.

167
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:51,778
You need to work with others on your team
when creating your KPIs as well as making

168
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:57,628
sure your team has continued access to
your KPIs, your goals and KPIs should

169
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,238
also fit with your other goals and KPIs

170
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:03,628
Will failing one of your
goals affect your other goal?

171
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,628
If so, then you need
to make an adjustment.

172
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,238
Be intentional when
you're creating your KPIs.

173
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:16,933
It is better to have a few meaningful KPIs
rather than a bunch of metrics that are

174
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,943
unimportant or difficult to understand.

175
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,663
You will want to start by
considering direct measurements.

176
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:28,213
If you want to increase revenue, the
total revenue by month or year would be

177
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:34,633
an example of a direct measurement, but
some things can't be measured directly.

178
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:38,143
For example, if you want to
measure something more intangible,

179
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,793
like customer satisfaction.

180
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:44,083
You could use indirect measures,
such as C-SAT surveys, average

181
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,943
return rate or repurchase rate.

182
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:51,283
If you're using indirect KPIs,
it is safer to use more than one.

183
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:55,663
You should also be careful that
you don't use bad proxy measures.

184
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,483
Talk to your team while
you're creating your KPIs.

185
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:06,523
It is better to work with others,
to create the KPIs than it is to

186
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:08,023
be halfway through your project.

187
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,593
Only to have someone ask if those
measurements are really effective,

188
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,983
KPIs do not have to be perfect, but
they do need to command the confidence

189
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,303
of everyone who will be using them.

190
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,453
Creating buy-in for your KPIs is time.

191
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,333
You need to invest at the start,
but it's also time well spent.

192
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:31,423
Again, goals can be used on
multiple levels within your company.

193
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:35,143
You can have different goals and KPIs
set for your business as a whole.

194
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:39,703
And then each of the individual teams,
common company goals include revenue,

195
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:43,393
growth, profit margin increase,
and customer growth and retention.

196
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,773
When you are setting strategic company
goals, you should be able to explain

197
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,633
how that supports the company's mission.

198
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,083
With customer retention.

199
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,953
For example, your goal may be to
maintain a 75% retention rate.

200
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,473
Your target would be 75% and one of
your KPIs might be customer turn rate.

201
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:09,163
Instead of focusing on overall
company goals, you might be

202
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,903
focusing on your individual team.

203
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:14,623
When setting goals for your
individual teams, they should

204
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,613
support the overall company strategy
for your customer support team.

205
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:22,903
You might set a goal as customer
satisfaction or retention for marketing.

206
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:27,913
It might be increasing organic search
growth for organic search growth.

207
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:31,933
Your KPIs could include something like
the number of customers you acquire

208
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,033
through organic growth month over month.

209
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:42,988
So let's take a look at a couple of
examples of smart KPIs for different teams

210
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,538
for your customer service or support team.

211
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:52,528
You might use KPIs like first
response time resolution rate,

212
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,868
and customer satisfaction ratings
using customer surveys or C-SAP.

213
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:03,208
For your customer service or support
team, you might use KPIs like first

214
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,438
response, time resolution rate, and
customer satisfaction ratings using

215
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,388
something like customer surveys or SEASET

216
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,118
your project management KPIs might
include things like on time completion,

217
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:23,018
percentages, milestones on time
percentages and budget variances.

218
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:32,173
Your marketing team might use KPIs like
new customers, upsell and cross-sell rates

219
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,063
and social media return on investment.

220
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,893
When creating your KPIs, you should
also be aware of two different types

221
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:44,923
of indicators lagging and leading.

222
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:50,063
So what's the difference between
lagging and leading indicator.

223
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:53,563
A lagging indicator
measures past performance.

224
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,403
Whereas a leading indicator is a
predictive measure of future performance.

225
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,813
Generally, we are most interested
in a lagging indicators.

226
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:10,633
However, if those lagging indicators
take a long time to materialize,

227
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:14,623
maybe something like revenue per
quarter, then it's a good idea to

228
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,783
track leading indicators as well.

229
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:19,553
That way you can make
better decisions day-to-day.

230
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:24,418
To look at a short example.

231
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:27,448
If you're measuring your cashflow
payments received would be an

232
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,158
example of a lagging indicator.

233
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,618
It measures what has already happened.

234
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:35,998
Whereas invoices issued would be
an example of a leading indicator

235
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:40,108
because it measures the cash you are
likely to receive in the near future.

236
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,498
It is only predictive because
it's not guaranteed that everyone

237
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:45,378
will pay or even pay on time.

238
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:50,488
A longer-term example of leading and
lagging indicators might be share of

239
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:55,258
market or share of voice share of market
measures, the percentage of revenue you

240
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:58,948
were responsible for within the whole
market compared to your competitors.

241
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,298
It's a lagging indicator, whereas
share a voice measures the percentage

242
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:08,518
of your brands media spend within the
market compared to your competitors.

243
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:13,693
And the excess share of voice compared to
your share of market is predictive of any

244
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,393
increase share of market in the future.

245
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,713
It's a leading indicator

246
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:26,043
along with lagging and leading
indicators, you also have qualitative

247
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:28,113
and quantitative indicators.

248
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:32,193
Quantitative indicators are
the most straightforward KPIs.

249
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,863
Basically they are measured
solely by a number.

250
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:41,318
There are two types of quantitative
indicators, continuous and discrete.

251
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:46,478
Whereas qualitative indicators
are not measured by numbers.

252
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,568
Typically a qualitative KPI
is a characteristic of a

253
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,368
process or business decision.

254
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:58,398
Again, quantitative KPIs are represented
by numbers and include things like

255
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,428
sales growth, customer lifetime value.

256
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:05,238
Number of resolve tickets,
customer acquisition costs.

257
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:09,523
Monthly recurring revenue
and service response time.

258
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:17,083
Qualitative KPIs, however
are not measured by number.

259
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,923
Therefore they are often thought
of as more difficult to gather.

260
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:25,663
Some ways to gather the qualitative
KPIs is through customer feedback,

261
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:30,703
anecdotes, stories, comments,
and responses to surveys.

262
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:39,738
Beyond leading lagging qualitative and
quantitative indicators, there are a

263
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:41,958
number of other indicators as well.

264
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:50,908
There are input indicators which are
used to measure resources needed for

265
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:55,428
a process or project and includes
things like equipment required.

266
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:01,003
Process indicators are meant to
measure the performance of a process

267
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,643
and facilitate any necessary changes.

268
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:09,343
Things like tickets resolved, tickets
opened and resolution times fall under

269
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:12,913
process indicators as they can tell
you how your support team is doing.

270
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:18,193
Output indicators, measure the success or
failure of a process, and are probably the

271
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:23,383
most commonly used KPI type and include
revenue, profits, and new customers.

272
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:30,358
Practical indicators measure the effect
of a process used by a business and

273
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,638
are typically unique to your business.

274
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:37,508
Directional indicators look
at trends within your company.

275
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,908
Where are the metrics moving?

276
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:40,868
Are they improving?

277
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,578
Declining, maintaining.

278
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:47,898
Actionable indicators measure the
effectiveness in implementing business

279
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,238
changes, including things like processes.

280
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:55,173
And lastly, financial indicators
measure economic stability,

281
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,793
growth and business viability.

282
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:02,973
These KPIs are things like gross profit
margin, net profit and asset ratios.

283
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,453
They typically provide the most
straightforward insight into the

284
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:10,863
financial health of a company, but they
are usually best paired with other KPIs

285
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,673
in order to provide a full picture.

286
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:19,943
When creating your KPIs, there are a
lot of things you need to make sure

287
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:23,963
to remember to do, but there are also
some things you want to avoid as well.

288
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:29,543
The first thing you want to
avoid is bad proxy measures.

289
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,013
As mentioned earlier.

290
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:34,283
Sometimes there are things we want
to measure, but are either difficult

291
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:36,533
to measure or are intangible.

292
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:40,343
In those situations we may
measure a KPI we think is related,

293
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,933
and this is a proxy measure.

294
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,483
It's not bad to use proxy
measures, but it is easy to use

295
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,253
bad ones if you aren't careful.

296
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:52,963
For instance, an increase in social
media followers does not necessarily

297
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,913
increase positive brand sentiment.

298
00:19:56,413 --> 00:20:02,653
KPIs should be measured by performance,
not activity, making a KPI like post

299
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:08,113
five social media post, for example, is
measuring activity, but creating a post

300
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:10,903
with 5,000 impressions is performance.

301
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:20,008
You want to make sure that you avoid
using weasel words, weasel words are words

302
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:25,228
that are ambiguous words like effective,
optimize, streamline, and so on.

303
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:29,338
They make it sound important,
but they aren't measurable and

304
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:33,298
therefore should be avoided when
creating your KPIs, and your goals.

305
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:37,513
You also need to make sure you're
sharing your KPIs with your team, as it

306
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:41,923
tells your team what is important and
should be inspiring them into action.

307
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:46,993
You also want to make sure you
don't forget to review your KPIs.

308
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:51,343
Unfortunately, so many people go
through the long and sometimes tedious

309
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:55,363
process of developing KPIs, but then
don't look at them until the end of

310
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,213
the year or until the project is over.

311
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:02,633
By tracking KPIs and keeping them
visible, you can continually spark action

312
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:04,193
and focusing attention of your team.

313
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:10,683
As mentioned previously, it is very
important to keep your KPIs visible

314
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:12,363
and to be able to track them easily.

315
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:16,773
An excellent way to do that
is to use a KPI dashboard.

316
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:22,233
A KPI dashboard provides management a
platform for monitoring and analyzing.

317
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:27,073
It allows companies to track the
performance of individuals, departments,

318
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,533
teams, or even the entire company.

319
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:34,513
Dashboards enable management to see
trends quickly and can be alerted to the

320
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:37,333
KPIs that have exceeded set thresholds.

321
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:46,123
You can create your own dashboard or you
can use one of the many existing options

322
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:49,003
such as Domo, good data and power BI.

323
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:54,133
You might also already use a platform
that includes this type of dashboard.

324
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:59,643
For instance, if you're using a support
platform like Zendesk, Salesforce, or

325
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,163
live agent, they all include dashboards.

326
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,433
If you decide to create your
own KPI dashboard, here are a

327
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,543
couple of things to remember.

328
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:13,043
You want to keep it since.

329
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,568
Limit the number of KPIs to a single
screen for specific objective project

330
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:22,318
or department overlooking cause
users to miss vital information.

331
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:27,448
You should show a trend over time
because, for a graph or data to really

332
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:29,968
be useful, it needs context and history.

333
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,328
You want to tell a story
with your dashboard.

334
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:36,778
Any graphical interpretation
is best understood if it's

335
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:38,178
in the context of the story.

336
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,858
Overpowering color schemes
can cause your dashboard to be

337
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:47,298
illegible, pick a clean and simple
color palette for your dashboard.

338
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:55,078
When you're creating your dashboard,
you want to keep in mind the

339
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,578
type of dashboard that you need.

340
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,228
Strategic dashboards are mostly used
to view the business as a whole.

341
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,778
They are a great way to see
the company's current status.

342
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:08,683
Operation dashboards are typically
used by managers and employees

343
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:09,973
and provide real-time data.

344
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,963
Analytical dashboards are
used for investigation of any

345
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:15,763
unexpected anomalies and data.

346
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,663
They are sometimes called KPI
reports in our tool to determine

347
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:21,193
the cause of any fluctuations.

348
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:33,723
Another step we emphasized not to
skip is reviewing your KPIs regulary.

349
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:38,083
Click.com has outlined an
excellent KPI iteration process.

350
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,983
First, you want to make sure
you schedule a recurring cycle.

351
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:47,143
You'll want to create a schedule based on
your own business and your business needs.

352
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:53,143
When reviewing your KPIs, make sure you're
asking the right questions such as what

353
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:58,863
trends or changes am I saying, are any
of these KPIs underperforming, and so on.

354
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:03,013
After you've reviewed and questioned
your current KPIs, the next step is to

355
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:07,093
make any updates to them and then make
sure everyone knows of the changes.

356
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:14,773
As we learned today, there are
many types of KPIs you can use.

357
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,063
Because it's a measurement, the natural
assumption is that KPIs should always

358
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:21,133
be a number, something we can count.

359
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,183
However, evaluation particularly
of service and customer

360
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:26,503
experience often go beyond.

361
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:32,918
To get a true, complete picture
of your business, past present,

362
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:36,548
and future, understanding all
the types of KPIs as essential.

363
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:41,678
Each one provides valuable insight that
can inform strategic decision-making

364
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:42,818
and business development.

365
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,148
So when you walk away from
this session today, there are a

366
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:51,018
couple of things you should know.

367
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:57,013
First goals, KPIs, targets and
metrics are not all the same thing.

368
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:03,943
And when creating your KPIs, remember
to start with your goals, keep your

369
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:09,463
KPIs smart, or maybe even smart
ass, evaluate them often and make

370
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:10,753
sure to share them with your team.

371
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:14,683
Thank you for joining me today
to learn more about KPI's.

372
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:15,503
Dan Maby: How you doing Elise?

373
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:16,843
Thank you so much for your session today.

374
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,003
Thank you sharing it with us.

375
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:21,313
Elise Alley: Thank you.

376
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,083
Thank you for having me.

377
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:24,603
Michelle Frechette: Absolutely.

378
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:28,333
I, um, I just want to say you
are a smart ass was kick ass.

379
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:34,933
Absolutely.

380
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,093
I'm just going to check.

381
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:40,993
I don't think we had any questions come
in from the chat at all, but I know

382
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:43,573
Dan and I probably have a few for you.

383
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:49,888
Um, I have the pleasure of getting to
work with Elise and so I've, um, but we

384
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:53,038
have never talked about, we don't have the
same team and we have not talked about,

385
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,618
um, you know, KPIs and things like that.

386
00:25:55,918 --> 00:26:00,208
But when I hear acronyms like that,
like KPIs and measurements, I know

387
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:02,758
that there are some people that
those are triggering things, right?

388
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:03,838
Like it's a scary thing.

389
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:07,228
When you start to talk about what you're
responsible for those kinds of things.

390
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:10,828
What are some ways that you
can think of that can kind

391
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:13,408
of take the stress out of it?

392
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:14,938
Maybe game-ify it.

393
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:18,508
Um, and have fun with meeting goals?

394
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:20,608
Elise Alley: Sure.

395
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:26,743
Um, it's not something it's
not something, a stressor that

396
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:28,123
I've really come across before.

397
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,733
If for me, it's, you know, we have a goal.

398
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:32,743
And so it's the question
of how do we achieve it?

399
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:35,203
And that's what KPI KPIs are.

400
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,653
So, you know, getting away
from the initials and all of

401
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:40,993
that, that can be intimidating.

402
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:43,093
It's just, what do we want to do?

403
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:44,623
Where do we want to go?

404
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:46,483
How do we achieve these things?

405
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,708
And, uh, finding ways to do that.

406
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,878
And, you know, so working with our
teams to finding different ways to

407
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,408
complete the things that we need to do.

408
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,558
Michelle Frechette: Yeah,
that makes perfect sense.

409
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:03,838
Um, what I was working at give WP,
sometimes we would, um, set different

410
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:08,518
goals to kind of outside of our
normal, regular KPI type structure of

411
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:12,568
like, let's have a contest to see who
can get the most five star reviews

412
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:14,278
this month, those kinds of things.

413
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:17,158
What do you think about using
some of those incentives to

414
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:19,018
help move the team forward?

415
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:23,038
Um, and, uh, you know, adding a
little bit of gamification just

416
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:24,318
to keep things insteresting.

417
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:25,568
Elise Alley: Sure.

418
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,953
It's always fun when you get a
chance to, to compete with people.

419
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:34,063
Some of us are more competitive
than others, uh, myself included.

420
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:37,663
So, um, it never hurts to game-ify things.

421
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:43,363
We, you know, I work primarily in
support and our goal is always to help

422
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:44,983
our customers and make them happy.

423
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:50,823
Um, so we do little things like we
do, you know, make sure that we're

424
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:55,303
reading positive reviews, not just
for ourselves, but I make sure in

425
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,753
our support meetings that I'm reading
positive reviews from customers.

426
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:03,313
I, um, my support supervisor sends out
a newsletter every month that has like

427
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,963
positive reviews and that sort of thing.

428
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:10,483
So, uh, not necessarily gamifying,
but I want to highlight what an

429
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,463
awesome job our team is doing.

430
00:28:12,913 --> 00:28:17,338
Um, And so making sure everyone else
sees that, and they're getting positive

431
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:20,548
feedback, not just from customers, but
then they hear back from the rest of

432
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:25,408
the team who doesn't always see what's
going on in support um, but they get to

433
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:29,308
hear, you know, from our developers and
stuff saying what an awesome job they're

434
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,728
doing as well, when they read those.

435
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:35,473
Dan Maby: Elise I think the KPIs
are, you know, they're, they're

436
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:38,173
incredibly important for business
development, business growth, you

437
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:41,353
know, expansion and, um, you know,
understanding where the business is.

438
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,833
But I think what would your, what
would your thoughts be around, uh, when

439
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,333
you're dealing with a smaller business?

440
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,843
So a solo in a, you know, a solo
business owner and individual that,

441
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:55,243
uh, maybe a freelancer, I, from
some of the conversations that I've

442
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:58,573
certainly had with freelancers, you
get into this idea of KPIs and itself

443
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:04,038
to become a bit, scary, a bit kind of
corporate  do you have any advice for

444
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:05,488
that kind of, that kind of demographic.

445
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:10,228
Elise Alley: Um, I think, you know,
it's similar to, to what I said before,

446
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:14,658
whatever, you know, whether you work for
a larger business or for yourself, you

447
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:19,318
have some sort of goal, uh, maybe as a
freelancer it's to no longer work for,

448
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:25,333
you know, this nine to five company and
to go out on your own, um, So, whether you

449
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:30,073
call that a goal or a dream, or however
you phrase it, that's still a goal, which

450
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:34,843
means there are action steps that you can
take and can measure to get to that point.

451
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:40,153
Um, so, you know, maybe it's
having X number of clients.

452
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,813
Um, once I hit this point and I'm
bringing in this amount of money, then I

453
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:46,573
can walk away from my nine to five job.

454
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:53,263
Again, no matter what size
company you are on your own or, or

455
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,063
however, it may be, you have goals.

456
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:58,623
And these KPIs are just
action steps to get there.

457
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:03,238
Dan Maby: Absolutely I did.

458
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:04,998
There was a comment coming
from the chat there.

459
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:08,938
Wouldn't this wouldn't that add
stress to the regular work stress,

460
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,398
Elise Alley: but I'll be honest.

461
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:14,628
I.

462
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:16,298
I love where I work.

463
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:19,688
I have no ambitions to go out on my own.

464
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:23,978
So, um, that is definitely not an
additional stress I would want to add,

465
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:28,358
but I do know people that really want
to work for themselves and so sometimes

466
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:31,868
you've got to balance both of those
stresses and it's not a lot of fun for

467
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:35,168
awhile, but if it gets you to where
you want to be, then it's worth it.

468
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:37,048
Dan Maby: Yeah.

469
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,378
I mean, I think the old, then you
can go back to the old kind of

470
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:43,378
adage of, you know, if you, if
you don't plan, you plan to fail.

471
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:43,698
Right.

472
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:48,778
Sort of, and actually know how do you,
as a, as a, as an individual, as a

473
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:53,698
freelancer or a remote worker that is
maybe potentially isolated and you're

474
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:57,298
working on their own, um, it can be
quite difficult sometimes getting

475
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:58,828
out of your own head and how do you.

476
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:03,328
Work out where the business is
going, or what, what direction do

477
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,708
you want to take your career in?

478
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:07,588
Um, and I think it all relates
back to what you're talking about

479
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,898
here in terms of the kind of
goal setting and understanding.

480
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:10,228
Elise Alley: Yes.

481
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:16,118
And also, you know, I mentioned that, you
know, being social, so with the pandemic

482
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:20,068
and everything maybe that limits it
some, but whether it's on phone calls or

483
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:24,418
slack chats or whatever it is, talk about
your goals with somebody else, they can

484
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:27,418
help you narrow down what that goal is.

485
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,018
They can help you figure out
what those steps need to be.

486
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:35,068
Um, so don't be afraid to share and
get other people involved, even if

487
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:38,488
you're working for yourself, you've
got friends and family who are going

488
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:42,208
to support your dream and can help
you work through the things that

489
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,588
you need to, to accomplish that.

490
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:49,813
Dan Maby: Absolutely just out of interest.

491
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:50,713
And they're just another question.

492
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:55,148
Do you, do you, um, You don't
necessarily do answer this, but

493
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,408
just the question around, do you
set KPIs within your personal life?

494
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,208
Is that something that you apply across?

495
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:01,778
Elise Alley: I do not.

496
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:07,708
It is something I, um, when I first
became a support supervisor for I

497
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:11,608
themes, uh, we didn't really, we
had never had a support supervisor.

498
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,408
We had never had KPIs.

499
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,548
Um, so I was basically, I'd been
with the team for a long time, but it

500
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:19,228
was basically starting from scratch.

501
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:20,608
Um, and so.

502
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:25,183
What are the first things I did was
create goals and KPIs, um, and have

503
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:28,093
worked with, you know, the other
teams and stuff and helped people

504
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,833
create KPIs and stuff as well.

505
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,043
So it's not something I do
outside of work, but have,

506
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,083
have done quite a bit inside.

507
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,318
Michelle Frechette: Oh, it is
the middle of the night for you.

508
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:44,428
And we appreciate you coming on
to do a live Q and a with us.

509
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:45,538
Um, talk.

510
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,618
It was a great talk.

511
00:32:46,618 --> 00:32:51,868
And I think that, um, you know, definitely
is what I'll be glad as on the, um, you

512
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:56,278
know, at our library of talks for, for
future reference for other people as well.

513
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:57,548
Great.

514
00:32:57,818 --> 00:32:58,748
Thank you so much, Elise.

515
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,578
I also want to thank
our sponsors Bluehost.

You might even win some prizes.

519
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:13,268
There's some, uh, wheels
you can spin for prizes.

520
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:16,868
I actually won something from
Nexcess, uh, and we work there.

521
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,178
So I don't know how that's gonna
work, but we'll figure it out.

522
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:22,478
I'll send it over to the photo.

523
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,598
Our photo booth is sponsored by
multicolor lab and dream host.

524
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:28,158
And those are so much fun.

525
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,538
Dan, you did a great job
building the photo booth out.

526
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:33,198
I've already tweeted out a
couple of photos of myself.

527
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:34,728
Um, no Tiara this year.

528
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:42,973
We also, I think I have one of the other
room, maybe I'll maybe I'll fill it out.

529
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:47,653
We also want to thank our media
partners and our micro sponsors in the

530
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,473
community tent within the next hour
of Cloudways will have their hourly

531
00:33:50,473 --> 00:33:52,963
giveaway and the special guests activity.

532
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:53,803
And WeGlot ahead.

533
00:33:54,318 --> 00:33:57,018
Well I'm here, Nando joining
them at their session.

534
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,868
How could you be part of the five
for the future movement right now?

535
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:01,848
We would love your support.

536
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:03,528
Dan, tell him there's a button, right?

537
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:04,248
Where's the button?

538
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:05,208
Dan Maby: There is a button.

539
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:05,598
There's a button.

540
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:09,918

the menu on the left-hand side there,

541
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,628

542
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:15,948

00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:30,443
And the word, WordFest is open to all.

548
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:34,013
So if you've got a colleague, a
friend, somebody who's not, you're

549
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:35,123
not seeing in the community sent.

550
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:37,498
I think of a message

551
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:38,458
Michelle Frechette: drag.

552
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:43,348
Drag them in the in
it's worth it for sure.

553
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:44,458
At least I hope you could.

554
00:34:44,488 --> 00:34:46,678
I know it's late, but I hope you
could spend a few minutes in the

555
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,378
community tent saying hello to people.

556
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,628
We will be back on the hour.

557
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,628
We have a little bit of time head over
to the community tent, meet some people.

558
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:59,138
Um, on the hour we will be doing a
live interview with Topher DeRosia.

559
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:00,588
One of our organizers.

560
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:05,253
And, uh, just continuing on after
that with a whole bunch of fun stuff,

561
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:10,173
including one of our sponsor interviews
with, uh, probably gonna just destroy

562
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:14,463
his name, but Taco Verdonschot of Yoast.

563
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,643
He'll correct me later if I'm
wrong, but we'll, uh, we'll

564
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,323
see everybody back on the hour.

565
00:35:19,323 --> 00:35:21,183
