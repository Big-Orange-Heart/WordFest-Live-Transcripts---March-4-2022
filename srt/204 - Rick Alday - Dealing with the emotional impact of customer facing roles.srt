Matt Graham: Welcome back
to WordFest, stage two.

35
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:06,084
Uh, they say that lightning
does not strike twice.

36
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:11,185
Well, I beg to differ because we have two
lightning talks that are coming up next.

37
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,984
Uh, so we're going to watch them both
and then we'll do a live Q and A with

38
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:17,515
the presenters after we've watched them.

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,240
But first up is Rick Alday, uh,
with dealing with the emotional

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,730
impact of customer facing roles.

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,410
So Rick has been a graphic designer and
a photographer, but for the past decade,

42
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,400
he's worked in customer service roles
for different companies in the WordPress

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,989
industry and is currently with GiveWP.

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,000
So we'll see that video in a few seconds.

45
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:47,299
Rick Alday: My name is Rick Alday.

46
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,075
I'm a support technician at GiveWP.

47
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:55,424
For those of you who don't know what
GiveWP is, is just one of the best, uh,

48
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:57,435
WordPress donation plug-ins out there.

49
00:03:58,394 --> 00:03:59,625
That's my bias opinion.

50
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:06,795
And for the last 12 years or so, I have
been doing either tech support or customer

51
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:11,445
service, uh, roles in the WordPress
ecosystem for different companies.

52
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,915
Before that I did freelance
photography and graphic design.

53
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,680
So for the, a good 20 years of my
life, I've been doing, uh, dealing with

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,990
customers, uh, in one way or another.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,100
And I know from experience,
this can take an emotional and

56
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,650
mental and physical toll on you.

57
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,290
So I'm going to be sharing some of the
tips and tricks and procedures that I

58
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,200
use and learn throughout my, my career to
deal with some of that and minimize the

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,330
impact that it will have on your life.

60
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,440
Um, Stress is a part of our daily life.

61
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,520
You know, a certain amount of stress
is helpful for us to accomplish

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,190
our goals, uh, get through everyday
challenges, but just like cholesterol,

63
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:01,229
there's, there's good and bad stress.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,419
And the bad stress is really
harmful or your body or your health

65
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,310
or your mental health and job
related stress is not different.

66
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,830
All jobs are inherently stressful.

67
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,490
One way to.

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
But some more than others.

69
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,770
And I believe, uh, dealing with
customers is on the top level, right

70
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,930
there, you know, most stressful jobs.

71
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,000
And, um, as customer service
agents, we are often under extreme

72
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,730
pressure to, um, you know, deliver
and deal with complex issues.

73
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,820
We are usually the first point of contact
of customers with, uh, with the company.

74
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,150
So.

75
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,260
And customers don't usually reach out to
the company and that they have a problem.

76
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:54,120
And again, that sets the, the precedents
or the, uh, tone of the interaction

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,740
you're going to have with that customer.

78
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,219
And it's our job to turn that around.

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,820
There are plenty of great customers,
service agents out there, and no

80
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,250
matter how many years you've done this,
it's still can be a bit stressful.

81
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,305
How do we deal with this?

82
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:18,255
The approach we need to take to deal
with job related stress has, uh, two

83
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:22,395
components, uh, things that you do at
work and things that you do out of work.

84
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:27,315
That's first start reviewing
your work area, check your desk.

85
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:28,815
Is it comfortable?

86
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:33,375
Do you have pictures that cheer you up
pictures of your family, of your pet?

87
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,495
Can you look out the
window and see nature?

88
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:39,015
You know, is it organized
or do you have a big.

89
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:41,445
Is your chair comfortable?

90
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:42,945
Do you have good lightning?

91
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:48,104
Uh, do you have a plant maybe, uh,
you know, you need to work on your

92
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:52,215
work environment, your desk, your
office, it has to be comfortable.

93
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,015
This is where you're going to spend a good
chunk of your day over your reward days.

94
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:01,695
So make sure it has a nice atmosphere
and that's something you can control at

95
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:03,465
some point, you know, if you work for.

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,270
You can set up a small space where you
are, it's your space, you know, it's

97
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,820
your workspace, it's your dedicated
space for work as nothing else, you

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,990
know, just your computer, maybe,
you know, printer, if you need it.

99
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,930
And just the basic stuff that
you need to work and things that,

100
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,830
you know, make it look nice, make
it, makes it comfortable for you.

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Um, I know this is difficult.

102
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,160
If you live in a small apartment or
if you share your, your house or your

103
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,930
apartment with other people you have,
if you have family or pets, it can be

104
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,940
a challenge, but it's not impossible.

105
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,400
So make sure your, your work
environment is as comfortable as it

106
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,450
can possibly be for you to spend,
you know, eight hours a day there.

107
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,510
Next, when you do start work, um, start.

108
00:07:58,785 --> 00:07:59,225
Easier.

109
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:03,105
And what I mean, my dad is, uh,
start with things that required a

110
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,785
little mental energy and GiveWP.

111
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:12,225
We have something called a mental
energy kickoff or Mico acronym, M E K O.

112
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:17,895
And basically what this means is that
we start the day with a task that

113
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:22,755
requires a little mental need, mental
energy from our part, you know, it can

114
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:33,780
be answering, um, emails, um, Uh, taking
notes, um, reviewing your documentation,

115
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,520
et cetera, something that, you know,
you, you, you know, it's not gonna

116
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,960
take a long time and it's not going
to stress you out and start with that.

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:50,070
And then you can jump right into
the fire next stick, small breaks

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,650
every hour or every 40 minutes.

119
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,570
Step away from your computer.

120
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,880
Go, go for a.

121
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:03,494
Go for a glass of water, you know,
stretch out, do some breathing exercises.

122
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:07,724
You can find some great breathing
exercises on YouTube that will only

123
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:12,944
take one or two minutes and breathing
exercises will help you regulate your

124
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:19,694
heart rate to if you are person who
suffers from anxiety or, you know yeah.

125
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,844
It'll help you calm down and just.

126
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:27,285
Relax, what a bit, eh, you need
to do that throughout the day.

127
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:34,405
You know, it helps you also clear
your mind and kind of reset your,

128
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:38,985
your mental energy a bit, so
you can continue your Workday.

129
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:42,615
It's very important
that you do that again.

130
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:47,925
Just five minutes, 10 minutes stops
and you go back to work refresh.

131
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,055
It really helps.

132
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,910
Next thing you want to
do is avoid multitasking.

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,680
You know, I know this is, uh, some people
consider this an asset, but not, I'm not

134
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,770
going to agree with that in my experience.

135
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,000
Multitasking just wears you out really
quickly and physically and mentally.

136
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,290
I know, I know every job has
a different tasks that you

137
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,790
need to accomplish every day.

138
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,150
That's.

139
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,740
What I mean is that you need to
break those tasks into chunks.

140
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,400
For example, I'm going to set up,
uh, I'm going to work on email

141
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,590
for 20 minutes and just email.

142
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm not going to do every, anything else.

143
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,090
Uh, and after that, I'm
going to spend 30 minutes.

144
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,820
I don't know, writing that documentation.

145
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,600
All right.

146
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,090
So I'm just going to
concentrate on that and then.

147
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,094
You know, and the next 40 minutes
I'll do something else, but

148
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,864
you know, just that one task.

149
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:52,724
And that way I can cover all the tasks
that I need to cover throughout the

150
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,454
day, but I have to do them all at once.

151
00:10:56,145 --> 00:11:01,995
Now, again, do this as much as possibly,
you know, you can, I know that if you

152
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,645
work from home, there are distractions.

153
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:07,724
If you have family in small kids,
it's almost, you know, you're going

154
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:10,364
to get interrupted quite a bit.

155
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:11,415
I know from experience that.

156
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,560
And just the job.

157
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,790
Sometimes you need to like, stop
doing what you're doing and you need

158
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,330
to take care of something that's,
uh, you know, origin or really

159
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,560
important and it needs to be done.

160
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,980
So I understand that sometimes you
cannot avoid multitasking 100%, but

161
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,380
try to do that as much as you can.

162
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,740
And, you know, uh, this apply,
it goes to your breaks to.

163
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,245
when you go, take your lunch break.

164
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:45,885
You're taking your lunch break Dawn,
you know, don't check your notification

165
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:50,445
from work, uh, try to put your phone
away and just enjoy your lunch.

166
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:55,425
And if you're, you know, taking a lunch
with a friend or family, just spend some

167
00:11:55,425 --> 00:12:00,585
time with them, concentrate on that, you
know, don't check your phone, doesn't

168
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:03,015
wander off, you know, or think about work.

169
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:07,305
Just turn off your work
mode and enjoy your life.

170
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,790
When I rude customer comes along
and they often do, they come with

171
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,030
insults, they come with complaints.

172
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,740
They're really frustrated.

173
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,660
And what you need to do first
is don't take it personally.

174
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,579
I know from experience by
instinct, we take it personally.

175
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,560
We take it very, you know,
to heart, any insults or.

176
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:41,455
Whatever, um, problem is the, the
client comes with, but just agree time

177
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:49,635
to step away a minute or two breeth
you know, calm down, never reply

178
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,285
it to a customer when you're mad.

179
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:52,785
Never do that.

180
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:58,035
It's just that, you know, they, they
would, the good book says on Proverbs

181
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:03,425
says a gentle answer, turns away
wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

182
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:08,385
For any situation you don't
fight, fight fire with fire.

183
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:15,705
You want to calm down and be the,
the better person and try to ignore

184
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:20,655
any insults, trying to ignore any
put downs, just work through your

185
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:27,795
way around, uh, trying to figure
out what's really behind that anger.

186
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,295
What's frustrating to the customer.

187
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,725
Try to put yourself in their shoes.

188
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,195
What are they experiencing?

189
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,590
That's got them so frustrated
and what you do about it.

190
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,260
Can you solve it in your hands?

191
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,300
Not, you know, be as polite as
possible and just let them know that.

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,340
And if you need to, you can scale
that, escalate that to a supervisor.

193
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,110
Sometimes you don't need to deal with,
uh, customers, you know, supervisors have

194
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,360
the authority to maybe fire the customers.

195
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,490
They are, they're being really rude.

196
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,590
So yeah.

197
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,870
Talk to a supervisor to talk
to our coworkers, don't handle

198
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,130
angry customers yourself.

199
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,810
You don't need to ask for help.

200
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,339
There's nothing wrong with that.

201
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,000
No snacks.

202
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,040
Uh, another tip that you know, really
works right, is listening to music.

203
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,670
I know this is cliche.

204
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,300
Everyone says, you know,
you're going to listen to.

205
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,990
Calm music or whatever, but, you
know, whatever music suits you, you

206
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,170
feel like, you know, heavy metal
and head back to what you're doing.

207
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,830
That's fine.

208
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,510
Just be mindful.

209
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,920
Your coworkers, you, you know, working
at share office, you know, put your

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,660
headphones on and, and jam away, you
know, if you like jazz or whatever,

211
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:54,630
something that really helps you, uh, hypes
you up and doesn't interfere with the.

212
00:14:55,515 --> 00:15:01,725
Go ahead and do that, uh, on a tip,
do not procrastinate on difficult

213
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,855
tasks or tests that you don't like.

214
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:08,985
We all have that one thing that
we don't like to do at work.

215
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,545
You know, we don't like it as much.

216
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:13,125
It's not our favorite thing,
but it has to be done.

217
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:20,325
And our tendency is to put it off,
you know, kick the can down the road

218
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,025
every day until the deadline of.

219
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,080
And now we're really stressed out because
we get to do it and it has to be done.

220
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,320
And, and we haven't even started yet.

221
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,580
So try to set up a time, you know,
uh, small, uh, time chunks of 10 to

222
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,410
15 minutes every day to tackle that,
uh, tasks that you are trying to

223
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,180
avoid that way, you know, 10 minutes
a day, by the end of the week, you

224
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,910
will have worked on it almost an hour.

225
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,040
And that's pretty good, you know?

226
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:58,935
But if you can do that, you know, can
set up more time to do that, go ahead

227
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,645
and do that, but do not procrastinate.

228
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:06,915
You know, eventually all tasks
will accumulate and that's

229
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:07,905
in the back of your mind.

230
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:10,605
You're thinking about that and
you're stressing out and you're

231
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,915
stressing out and that's not good.

232
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:20,535
Um, and another thing similar to
mental energy kickoff, you want to

233
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,245
decompress at the end of the day.

234
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:29,085
Uh, it's similar to, you know,
starting your day with a task that

235
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,585
requires a little mental energy.

236
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,425
Try to end your day with,
uh, doing similar tasks.

237
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:39,285
Uh, it could be just, you know,
10, 15 minutes before your shift,

238
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:45,255
just, you know, stop doing the hard
things and do the easier things.

239
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:50,505
You know, you can maybe write
up some notes, um, write some

240
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:51,705
more emails that require.

241
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,960
No research, um, read your docs again.

242
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,250
I don't know, thinks that, you know, you
know that your job will require a little

243
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,490
mental energy and finally end your day.

244
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,220
When you log off from
work, really do that.

245
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,170
You know, don't have a work
email installed on your phone.

246
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,520
Uh, don't have slack related,
uh, work groups in, in your

247
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,330
fall and things like that.

248
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:30,540
Um, just take time for you, you
know, you out of work, you've done

249
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,879
a great job and you know, you're
excellent, but now it's your time.

250
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,260
It's your family time.

251
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,070
It's time to do something else on a
personal level, you have to disconnect.

252
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:46,740
Um, again, set up a time to
really disconnect from internet,

253
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:53,420
really social media, uh, Do not
look at a screen for a good hour.

254
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,030
So if you have a hobby,
go ahead and do that.

255
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,640
If you work out, go ahead and do that.

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,210
You know, spend time with your family,
read a book, something that gets you away

257
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,680
from any screen really helps you out with
your mental energy and your mental health.

258
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,670
You know, especially at night, you don't
want to be checking your pond, you know,

259
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,220
on your bet before you go to sleep.

260
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,595
Um, It will helps you out.

261
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:28,185
You know, you have to step
away from any screen because

262
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,045
it also affects your vision.

263
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:38,265
It affects your, um, mental health
and, um, it'll eventually add up

264
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,675
to the next day and the next day.

265
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:44,985
So take an hour or so every
day to just disconnect from

266
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:47,285
everything and enjoy nature.

267
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:47,535
Can.

268
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:54,240
And you, your family and your hobbies
and, and your, your life, it's your time.

269
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,950
Another thing I want to point out
is that you need to encourage a work

270
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,260
stress discussion at the workplace.

271
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,720
And, um, I don't know if
your award allows for this.

272
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,510
You have, if you slack, or
if you use email or whatever,

273
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,360
but be able to communicate.

274
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,190
With your coworkers, with their
supervisors, um, about stressful

275
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,270
situations at job at your job
and how you can deal with that.

276
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,710
Uh, what can you do to minimize,
you know, stressful situations?

277
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,940
Because it, it, it doesn't, it, it
doesn't just help be you as an employee.

278
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,570
It helps them as an employer, you know,
um, according to study in the UK, Uh,

279
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,140
businesses are important to lose around
37 billion pounds, British pounds

280
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,880
every year and poor customer service.

281
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:00,060
And based on their, in that research,
uh, 73% of consumers are reported

282
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,780
to select a company or product
based on friendly employees or

283
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,430
customer service representatives.

284
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,950
So this is where a happy employee
can make a big difference in

285
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,260
terms of, or of sales and revenue.

286
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,540
You know, like I said, in the
beginning, all jobs are somewhat

287
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,140
stressful and people are different.

288
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,940
We all handle stress differently.

289
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,740
We'll have personal, uh, issues
that we have to deal with every day.

290
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,250
And that, you know, it's
another variable movie.

291
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,120
Our employers cannot control
that, but there are things that

292
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,770
can be, you know, minimize.

293
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,690
Done differently at work
that could minimize just

294
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,070
general stress for all of us.

295
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,720
So I'll be sure to talk to your
supervisors, your higher ups

296
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,480
and, um, if your company is not
open to that, maybe it's time to

297
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,060
look somewhere else, you know?

298
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,540
Um, sadly, uh, but it is
your health after all.

299
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,100
So be sure to take care of it and.

300
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:09,795
That's pretty much it.

301
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:18,075
And, you know, uh, just wanted to
share that as a side note, that I also,

302
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:23,865
uh, dealt with depression and anxiety
for many years of my life, and I've

303
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:28,545
applied these dips to my personal life
and they've really helped me out, you

304
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:32,745
know, um, at the end of the day, you
need to take care of yourself too.

305
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,340
You need to eat healthy.

306
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,140
You need to get out.

307
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,780
I sleep in that's really important.

308
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,850
Take care of your physical health too,
because that will also affect your mental

309
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:53,100
health obviously, and ticket one day
at a time, you know, don't quit smoking

310
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,920
culture keyed on, you know, stopping
carbs, cold Turkey that doesn't work.

311
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,480
It's one step at a time.

312
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,580
You are not alone.

313
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,010
If you need help, definitely
reach out friends, family, um,

314
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,860
open to, uh, messages, Sue.

315
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,300
Um, I don't tweet much, but I, you
know, you can reach out to me and

316
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:20,550
share your experiences, say hi or
prayer request and you know, whatever.

317
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,720
Uh, I'm good.

318
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,580
Uh, and I'll be happy to share
on a more personal level.

319
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,550
My experiences.

320
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:33,305
Uh, things that I do on everyday
basis to deal with that again, it's

321
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:34,425
your mental health take care of it.

322
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:35,205
Take care.

323
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:36,255
Bye.

324
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,165
Matt Graham: Welcome back.

325
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:47,145
So we have, uh, both Nate and Rick
here to answer your questions.

326
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:50,575
Nate Finch: Hello.

327
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:55,725
Matt Graham: Awesome talks.

328
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:02,895
If they hit, they hit a chord,
obviously different courts with meaning.

329
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:07,725
Um, the last, uh, last eight months,
I've been kind of going through a tough

330
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:13,575
time with, uh, with my mental health,
but I was playing around with headless

331
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,075
WordPress, probably I wanna say six years.

332
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,595
I actually did it.

333
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:25,815
I actually did a talk, uh, in,
um, we're, uh, WordCamp Hamilton

334
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,545
about, uh, about doing a.

335
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:35,100
Um, using WordPress as like an
app development, uh, framework.

336
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,740
So yeah, what you're talking
about is really cool.

337
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,070
Yeah.

338
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,379
Nate Finch: That's fun, man.

339
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,710
That's a bit about too in that, uh,
uh, we're using WordPress for web apps

340
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,880
book came out, actually, I'm trying to
remember the guys at WebDev Studioes

341
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,110
Matt Graham: I haven't actually had
a chance to read that one over yet.

342
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,070
Rachel Winchester: I have a
question about how you first, uh,

343
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,790
I guess, got into JAMstack and
building static WordPress sites.

344
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,780
And really like when that
moment for you, when it clicked

345
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,280
that this is the way to build.

346
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:09,345
Nate Finch: Yeah, that's a great question.

347
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:14,205
Um, I think for me, at least I think
it's different for everybody, but when

348
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:18,765
you see, I think like, I don't know, I
grabbed a Gatsby theme first starter.

349
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,175
It wasn't a few, it was,
it started as before.

350
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:25,575
And it's like, you know, you, I think
you've just come out of, and they had

351
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:30,075
like the, uh, WordPress course, it
was really just like plug and go and

352
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,835
how easy it was to like get started.

353
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,700
Kind of get it going well, I don't know.

354
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,780
Easiest relative term.

355
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,440
Absolutely.

356
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,129
Um, so back it up a little bit
there, but like Netlify had their

357
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:44,669
free hosting still does, like
my personal site is still there.

358
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,240
And so you just like deploy it
and you're like, oh, that's there.

359
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,500
And it's just pulling all
this information from my site.

360
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:51,420
Well, that's cool.

361
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,230
And so the tools are there, you know, so I
think it was just like, kind of the right

362
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,000
moment when Gatsby kind of came along
and, uh, Netlify came along to really

363
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
have, uh, an easy way to get that up.

364
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,790
So I know there's other solutions now,
uh, through Vercel, through Strattic,

365
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:11,580
through all sorts of like headless options
and stuff like that and static options.

366
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,650
And everything's.

367
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,530
Yeah, but I think for me, it was
just like seeing the speed and, you

368
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,679
know, Gatsby has the, um, what is it
called where you hover over a link

369
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,820
and it like, pre-loads the page.

370
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,540
So it was just like, just so fast
and the images look so crisp and

371
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,810
clean and there's just so little
that you have to do or whatever.

372
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,939
So, yeah, I was like, this is cool.

373
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:31,794
That was great.

374
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:32,814
Rachel Winchester: Nice.

375
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:37,284
I been getting into
JAMstack about a year now.

376
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:45,024
Um, but not as a developer WordPress,
um, and while getting into it, I've

377
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:46,705
been listening to so much heavy metal.

378
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,405
So I like how Rick.

379
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,530
To heavy metal and that people can
listen to whatever music that you like.

380
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,000
So I'm curious, what kind of music
do you listen to throughout your day?

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,080
What do you like to work to?

382
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,490
Rick Alday: Oh man, like my music
taste is really all over the place

383
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,560
and um, you know, I, I can share
some way in my playlist and some

384
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,770
of them I'd rather than that, but
yeah, I mean, I just listened to.

385
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,250
Well, I'm working at drink to loosen,
to like some like low-fi music.

386
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,689
Uh, but again, it depends on
my mood and what I'm doing.

387
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:34,260
Uh, I definitely, you know, head
bang sometimes, and I have my

388
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,240
kid like working next to me.

389
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:43,080
She's taking a homeschool at moments,
or I cannot put out my music too loud.

390
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,305
I use my headphones and, but, um,
yeah, I mean, It depends on my mood.

391
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:53,565
So it varies quite a bit.

392
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:54,945
Matt Graham: Yeah.

393
00:26:54,945 --> 00:27:00,885
So I guess speaking of variability,
what is that one thing that

394
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,805
you need to do every day to.

395
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,190
Yourself, like I want to stay sane,
but really the, the thing is focused.

396
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,740
What is that one thing
that you always need to do?

397
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:11,639
Rick Alday: Okay.

398
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:16,170
Um, what works for me is
taking a lot of breaks.

399
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,960
Like a lot of five minute breaks,
every 40 minutes every hour.

400
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,040
I need to just step out of the office and.

401
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,700
I just, just go, ah, what
are my plants and our yard?

402
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,980
And that's like, what I like to do.

403
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,050
I like to do gardening on my time
off and that just like completely,

404
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,460
completely just takes me away.

405
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,955
Any, uh, anything I'm working on online?

406
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:43,965
So, uh, one of my coworkers,
he lives in the near the woods.

407
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,935
He has like a large
property in South Carolina.

408
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:51,945
So, you know, he, he almost with the,
like coming to slack, I'm going to take

409
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:54,195
a walk in the woods and that was for him.

410
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:58,875
And so, yeah, but that's
something I need to do.

411
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:03,435
I need to go outside and look at
green style, look at plants, look

412
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:06,299
a flower, you know, But I do.

413
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,050
Rachel Winchester: Yeah.

414
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,340
I definitely understand that.

415
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,419
I think, uh, well, I don't know where,
where everyone's located in the world,

416
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,429
but where I am in the winter, you can't
get too much sunlight during the day.

417
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,129
So I have to leave and go outside
during lunch to even, get some sunlight.

418
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:28,830
Um, so yeah, I definitely, I definitely
feel that, um, going outside during

419
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,449
your work day and making a point of it.

420
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,605
Rick Alday: And just because I dunno, I
guess most of us work, you know, we're

421
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:41,175
sitting down all day, you know, working.

422
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:47,145
So just getting up, even getting,
you know, grabbing a cup of coffee

423
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:52,425
or just walking around like five
minutes, it really, you know, helps

424
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:57,314
you out with your back pain and,
you know, physically, mentally, it

425
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:59,534
just kind of resets you a little.

426
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,890
Rachel Winchester: Yeah, unless
you're too excited about the

427
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,970
develops develop the WordPress
static site that you're developing.

428
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,550
Nate Finch: I was actually the,

429
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,700
Matt Graham: yeah, that's the
question I wanted to ask you, Nate.

430
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,400
So I I'm a developer.

431
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:22,645
And I ha I feel like it could, I
don't know what it is, but I have this

432
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:25,375
rollercoaster of this is so cool too.

433
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:26,875
I hate this.

434
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:28,135
How do you go into that?

435
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:30,295
Nate Finch: Oh man.

436
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:30,985
Well, yeah.

437
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,685
And it's, it's also, you know, a
thing of like, oh, this is only

438
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:34,675
going to take me five more minutes.

439
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:35,065
I know.

440
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,805
And then five hours later,
you didn't go outside.

441
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:37,705
You didn't take your walk.

442
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:40,585
You didn't, you know, like say hi
to your family or something, working

443
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,895
at home or whatever and all that.

444
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,515
Um, yeah.

445
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:46,814
I don't know.

446
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:50,084
I'm still trying to figure that out
sometimes because I know that I'll,

447
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,384
you know, if I could I'd work like
all day and all night, and I just love

448
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:56,864
figuring all this stuff out is one of the
things I love about development, right.

449
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,554
Is that you're solving problems, like
figuring out puzzles and stuff like that.

450
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,745
So, um, yeah.

451
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:03,794
How do you deal with that?

452
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:07,754
I think like part of it is like, You know,
setting a timer for things, for sure.

453
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:10,545
Kind of like Rick was talking about,
you know, um, I think the other side

454
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:13,575
of it too, is to have multiple things
that you're trying to figure out, um,

455
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:17,655
that you're, or that, and if you have
other tasks you need to be doing that,

456
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,264
you're like, okay, I can only spend
like 30 more minutes on this before

457
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:21,585
I have to move on to something else.

458
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:26,504
And for me to like part, I was a
freelancer for, you know, six, seven

459
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:30,545
years or whatever, and joining a team,
uh, whether it's at a design agency

460
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:34,830
or now like Strattic where we're a
hosting company, um, You know, having

461
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,960
other people around you that have
those like have skills or can be your

462
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,430
rubber duck or, um, give you insight
and stuff like that to all that.

463
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,070
Like, if you can just like talk to
the people, like again, requisites

464
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,980
so much great advice, Rick,
that, uh, uh, it's super helpful.

465
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,899
Just feel like, figure those things
out and get unblocked and move forward.

466
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:01,830
You know, team like the sum, the total is
greater than the sum of its parts, right?

467
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,669
Yeah.

468
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,200
Matt Graham: Um, no, actually, uh,
AmyJune, which was one of the, uh, one of

469
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,050
the speakers earlier, uh, posted the, um,
the, from the developer Twitter account.

470
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,960
It's like, this'll just
be the five minutes fix.

471
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,980
Nate Finch: Yeah.

472
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:22,770
Five minute fixes every day.

473
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:23,820
Matt Graham: Yeah.

474
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,050
Right, exactly.

475
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:27,449
Right, right.

476
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,080
Exactly.

477
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,500
That's that's well, that's the limit
because if you go above that, then you

478
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,570
know, it ends up being an eight hour fix.

479
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,935
Rachel Winchester: Well, I, I
guess I have one more question.

480
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:47,365
Um, I'm curious, uh, w w with who
you deal with that at your job, um,

481
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:52,885
do people come to you excited about
static or do you have to convince them.

482
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,340
Nate Finch: Yeah.

483
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:01,200
So a lot of the folks that come to
Strattic are, you know, mid-size or

484
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,159
enterprise level folks that have been
running WordPress for years, and they

485
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:11,159
have worked on other hosting platforms
with their hosting companies and they

486
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,294
there's like this kind of sweet spot
sweet spotat Strattic where we can

487
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:19,345
take your WordPress site as it is and
make it static and then put that out.

488
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:23,845
And we also like build in these
serverless integrations, like for gravity

489
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:27,804
forms or contact form seven, or need
WordPress search or the list goes on.

490
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:28,044
Right.

491
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,385
Um, but they have been.

492
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,110
I told that if they want to do
something static, something fast and

493
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,830
scalable and secure that they need
to rebuild their site and stuff.

494
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:42,060
Well, you know, they've spent years on
this or, you know, tens of thousands

495
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,010
of dollars or hundreds of thousands of
people, hours or whatever on the site that

496
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,510
they have in the set up that they have.

497
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,740
And their marketers love it.

498
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,240
Their SEO, few people love it.

499
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,440
Their content writers love it.

500
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,550
They don't want to switch.

501
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,864
You know, a non WordPress
platform or whatever.

502
00:32:56,955 --> 00:33:01,334
Uh, and they don't want to have like a
deployment, like a, uh, a build process

503
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:04,814
necessarily where they have everything
he coupled where there's like, you

504
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:08,144
know, next she has her Gatsby on the
front end and WordPress on the backend.

505
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:11,685
And they're still dealing with that
security then too, because they

506
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:14,745
still have their WordPress site
up and it could still be taxed.

507
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,414
The folks that come to us are
basically saying like, Hey, when

508
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,634
you shut down WordPress, that means
that our WordPress can't be hacked.

509
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:20,629
That's great.

510
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:25,129
And then you have all these awesome
integrations and stuff that other hosting

511
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:30,169
static hosting platforms or a static kind
of integrations don't have out of the box.

512
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:35,540
Like I said to the PML for like one
multinational site and stuff like that.

513
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,629
So those are the kinds of things
that are like really important and

514
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,790
like the headache, like we were
just talking with somebody else who

515
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,840
was like, you know, you all have.

516
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,180
Not to say that we cost somebody
their job or whatever, but it's like,

517
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,180
you know, if we were doing what we
were doing before we came to strata,

518
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,990
we'd still have another person and a
half or something like that on staff.

519
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,490
That's just, just watching our site.

520
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,790
Right.

521
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,360
Like they're not doing anything
productive or whatever, they're just

522
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,250
trying to help us with the thing.

523
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,750
So, yeah.

524
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,300
So yeah, it's, it's cool.

525
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,360
That's kind of the same story,
uh, you know, two dozen different

526
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,440
ways and stuff like that.

527
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,009
Uh, come on.

528
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:13,504
Rachel Winchester: Yeah.

529
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:13,944
Yeah.

530
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:17,054
I'm very interested in, in, in,
um, how people are transitioning,

531
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:21,404
because I know it's, it's, it's
kind of new or it's coming back.

532
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:26,354
Um, but it keeps trying to, uh,
to, to, you know, get even more

533
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:27,854
popular, which is really interesting.

534
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:28,934
Nate Finch: Yeah.

535
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:29,264
Right.

536
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:30,614
Yeah.

537
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,464
Everything's uh, that was old is
new again or something like that.

538
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:33,764
Right.

539
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:34,874
So.

540
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:38,624
