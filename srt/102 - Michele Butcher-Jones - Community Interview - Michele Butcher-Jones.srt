00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:09,000
We are going to get to meet Michele,
one of our WordFest organizers.

34
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,580
Uh, we're going to take some time
with this round, this work fast,

35
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,900
to get to know our organizers.

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,620
They volunteered for a huge job,
and we just want to know why.

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,330
And we also want to know a
little bit more about that.

38
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:30,885
And, uh, who's contributing
to the Big Orange Heart.

39
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,255
Hi Michele.

40
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,655
Michele Butcher-Jones: Hello.

41
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,234
The first thing I thought of
when you're like, why, when you

42
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:49,845
said about why I'm choosing to
volunteer, I'm like a little crazy.

43
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,465
Cathy Tibbles: Oh, I'm glad you did.

44
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,655
So tell me about what you do.

45
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,165
Is it WordFest?

46
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:01,635
Do you volunteer with the
bigger, uh, orange hard as well?

47
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:05,984
Michele Butcher-Jones: Um, I haven't
really done that much with the Big

48
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:12,494
Orange Heart, but I've always been one
for promoting a better mental health,

49
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:18,675
um, better just, um, mental health
with working remotely and overall.

50
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:24,585
And anytime that I have seen
different things, uh, with Big

51
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:29,655
Orange Heart, um, Like promoting
them online and stuff like that.

52
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,575
I'm always like, yes,
these people are great.

53
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:37,875
And then, um, it came up to be a speaker
and I'm like, yeah, I'd like to do that.

54
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,165
Let me submit some things.

55
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:44,355
And then later I got a message saying
that they needed help in the volunteers

56
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:49,125
group, I guess, unfortunately,
um, previously had to back out

57
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,495
and I was like, sure, I can help.

58
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:57,375
Cathy Tibbles: Did you have any
idea what you were signing up for?

59
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:58,125
Oh,

60
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:58,905
Michele Butcher-Jones: not a clue.

61
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:03,645
Cathy Tibbles: So what is it, what's
your role that you're doing this time?

62
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,315
Michele Butcher-Jones: The volunteer lead.

63
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,205
Oh, yeah.

64
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:15,344
So wrangling, wrangling all the, uh,
all the volunteers, um, and making sure

65
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:20,984
that everything is covered or if not
covered the, one of the actual, uh,

66
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,554
volunteers team heads could jump in there.

67
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:30,115
And of course the way
I've been sick today.

68
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:34,895
So I'm not going to be able to help bye.

69
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,104
Cathy Tibbles: Your fired.

70
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:39,955
Mitsy Combs: I appreciate it.

71
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:40,495
And thank you.

72
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,865
Thank you for being understanding
of, I don't know what I'm doing.

73
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:45,175
Doing great

74
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:47,785
Michele Butcher-Jones: joked
around with a friend of mine.

75
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:50,005
I was like, this is not hurting cats.

76
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,565
This is hurting squirrels.

77
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:53,125
And they've all been part of it before.

78
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,635
Cathy Tibbles: How many of us are there?

79
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,525
Do you know the numbers

80
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,175
Michele Butcher-Jones: a lot?

81
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,565
Cathy Tibbles: It takes a
lot to put this event on.

82
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:12,935
Michele Butcher-Jones: See here, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, looking at a about.

83
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,375
60 volunteers like six, zero.

84
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,125
Yeah.

85
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,195
Mitsy Combs: Wow, bless you.

86
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,775
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah, it was quite bad.

87
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:27,585
When you look at all of the spreadsheets
that go into this, it's amazing,

88
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:34,395
Michele Butcher-Jones: especially why
there's not that many people who are

89
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,545
taking more than one shift and we've got.

90
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:47,294
Let's see, 18 different spots for
volunteers across six time periods.

91
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,495
And there's only four hours.

92
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:52,664
Yeah.

93
00:06:52,724 --> 00:07:00,575
Well, and there's only, uh, about, I'd
say ten-ish that are doing more than one.

94
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:04,525
Cathy Tibbles: That's awesome.

95
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:05,845
More people to help.

96
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:12,415
And this is how I, um, heard of Big Orange
Heart actually, and getting involved.

97
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,225
So it's, it's a great opportunity
to get, to meet some more

98
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,605
people behind the scenes.

99
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:18,865
Michele Butcher-Jones: Yes.

100
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,365
People doing really good work.

101
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:25,575
It also gives one of the things
I like about with, um, WordFest

102
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:30,555
is it's it was such a more calmer
atmosphere in a way in it's a good.

103
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,750
Stepping stone in a way for people
wanting to get into public speaking,

104
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:44,460
helping volunteer, giving back, um, in the
WordPress and remote community, because

105
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,750
you, when you, if you are wanting it
in public speaking, you don't have that

106
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,920
standing in a room in front of hundreds,
or like if your first one's working for

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,750
us, thousands of people, it's just in
a way you and your computer at first.

108
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,490
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah.

109
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,360
It's a good stepping stone.

110
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,450
How do you find the speakers?

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,970
I guess that's not your area.

112
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,140
Michele Butcher-Jones: That was not
my area on this one, but a lot of

113
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,970
times it's, um, just you put out
the call for it, the website and

114
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,500
put it out through social media.

115
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,270
And nine times out of 10, I've done
a number of WordCamps, including

116
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,900
WordCamp US, um, being on the
speaker team and being speaker

117
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,190
leads at different ones of them.

118
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,120
And usually you'll end up getting
almost double it's sometimes not true.

119
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,439
The amount of people submitting
for the top slots you have.

120
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:36,799
Cathy Tibbles: Wow.

121
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,439
Well, I guess it's good publicity as well.

122
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,659
They get to get their name out.

123
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,950
And a lot of people like with
speaking, volunteer, organizing

124
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,130
any of it, it's a lot of times
just people like to give back.

125
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,730
What is your, when you're not
volunteering, what is your full-time job?

126
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,040
Michele Butcher-Jones: Um, my
full-time job is I am, um, the

127
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,390
support team, um, specialists lead.

128
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,080
Um, at Thrive Digital Marketing Agency,
which is based out of Dallas, Texas.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,980
Um, I wrangle all of the support
specialists and, um, help assist with

130
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,080
the developers to make sure that our
developers have everything they need to

131
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,330
fix the sites to make the clients happy.

132
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,810
And then I also work a part-time job for
Cornell university doing content manage.

133
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:36,415
Cathy Tibbles: Wow.

134
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,545
You're a busy lady.

135
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,585
So do you spend any time at home?

136
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:45,145
Michele Butcher-Jones:
Oh yeah, I'm sleeping.

137
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:49,855
And then the weekends, and then I
also have a daughter who's a senior

138
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:54,745
in high school, this, so actually
next week we are going to visit the

139
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:58,795
college that she's, um, pick to go
to, which is university of Michigan.

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,420
Cathy Tibbles: I have
one in grade 12 as well.

141
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,980
It's very exciting.

142
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,520
Michele Butcher-Jones: I'm not ready
for all of this, graduation, you

143
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,290
just be pushed back another year.

144
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,250
I'm fine.

145
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,280
Cathy Tibbles: I know, I know.

146
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,220
It's really hard when
they grow up so fast.

147
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,569
We have, um, an interview with Bluehost.

148
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,460
Do you know.

149
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,444
If they're coming on?

150
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,805
Michele Butcher-Jones: They shouldn't be,

151
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,295
Cathy Tibbles: We get to
interview someone else.

152
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,035
Michele Butcher-Jones: Devon
Sears, who is a very fun guy.

153
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,055
If you've never met him.

154
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,454
Mitsy Combs: Okay.

155
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,330
Cathy Tibbles: So do you, can you
tell us how else we can get involved?

156
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,980
If we wanted to give back, like I've
heard there's a five, five and five.

157
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,820
What does that camp WordPress?

158
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,240
Right.

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,400
Michele Butcher-Jones: The word,
the press foundation is the ones

160
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,440
behind five, five, and five.

161
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,730
And what that does means is you give 5%.

162
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,520
Of your resources back to the WordPress
community, and that can be your individual

163
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,220
self, or your company, um, individual
self you're looking at only two hours

164
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,010
per week, and that could be spent, uh,
volunteering for, um, these types of.

165
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,050
Events that WordCamps,
WordFest, um, stuff like that.

166
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,260
It can be spending time in the, um,

questions on, um, plugins that you use
and, you know, the answers to it can be.

168
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,194
Cathy Tibbles: Uh, what's
the address for that?

169
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:52,185

171
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:00,224
Um, I can, I cannot remember

173
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,395
Cathy Tibbles: for the future.

174
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:04,755
Right.

175
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:05,655
Informative to me.

176
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,474
I keep saying five for five, five, right?

177
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,035
That sounds familiar.

178
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:10,454
Yeah.

179
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:17,145
Michele Butcher-Jones: And, um, Then for a
Big Orange Heart, you just, um, go online.

180
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:20,835
Um, um, you can do the monetary help out.

181
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:21,675
I know.

182
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,015
Oftentimes there is.

183
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,600
Options where Dan and co.

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,780
will message out saying we need
help with the actual organizing

185
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,150
team, whether that be in, um, social
media, helping out with that content.

186
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,480
I know they're always happy for, um, guest
writers to write a blog piece on like

187
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,690
their story for, um, how they got into
WordPress or story on mental health and

188
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,490
how they've overcome different things.

189
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,300
And I know for sure they're
looking for anything uplifting.

190
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,015
Cathy Tibbles: Who is
looking for those stories?

191
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,825
Michele Butcher-Jones:
Um, Big Orange Heart.

192
00:12:59,565 --> 00:12:59,955
Cathy Tibbles: Okay.

193
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,285
Okay.

194
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:01,785
I just missed that.

195
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:02,775
Yeah.

196
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:07,895
And a guest posting there, and then
we can also sign in for an account at

197
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:10,905
wordpress.org and answer questions.

198
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:13,065
Like you don't need any special training.

199
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,225
You just answer the ones that you know of.

200
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:20,265
And there's people asking everything
from how to log in to yes.

201
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:20,565
How to

202
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:20,835
Michele Butcher-Jones: code.

203
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,550
If you're into doing training, there's
a group for that in make.Wordpress.org,

204
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,760
where they're building out all kinds of
trainings, um, for as simple as what's

205
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,780
the difference between a post and the
page all the way up to they're starting

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,370
to get into more developer stuff.

207
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,770
Um, you can help out with marketing,
um, really, uh, WordCamps,

208
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,860
um, for the speaker sponsor.

209
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:55,214
Um, volunteers there's, um, Meta, polygons
is one that they always need help with.

210
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:59,204
If you are someone who speaks
multiple languages, they're always

211
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,305
looking for people to help translate.

212
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:03,854
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah.

213
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:06,194
There's always, there's some
way that we can get involved.

214
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:08,910
Michele Butcher-Jones: Yes.

215
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:14,790
It's and the, one of the things is
though to keeping the mind is it is

216
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,189
so much fun and it's actually kind of
addicting for doing volunteer work and

217
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:24,060
giving your time to something is the
most precious commodity you can give.

218
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,209
However, make sure you are holding
boundaries with yourself and

219
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,939
being able to take those breaks.

220
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,640
Not let yourself get burned out on.

221
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,810
Cathy Tibbles: How do you maintain
boundaries with two jobs and want to have

222
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,099
the time to do the stuff that feels good,
volunteer volunteers or giving back?

223
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,229
Like there's stuff that we want to do.

224
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,195
Michele Butcher-Jones: Do
as I say , not as I do.

225
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:55,215
Cathy Tibbles: So it's
a really good reminder.

226
00:14:56,985 --> 00:15:01,215
Michele Butcher-Jones: I'm one who
thrives more on the, always being on

227
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:06,315
the go, always having something to do,
um, type of personality when I'm awake.

228
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:10,365
I'm, you know, feet to the floor from
when I get up to when I go to bed.

229
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:16,845
Um, but I find a lot of joy and relaxation
in doing a lot of this kind of stuff.

230
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:20,505
We're it doesn't really feel like a job.

231
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:24,885
It does feel like a hobby, but when it
gets to be something that I've losing my

232
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:27,465
joy in, I do tend to take a step back.

233
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:29,325
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah.

234
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,135
That sounds smart.

235
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,235
Knowing who you are.

236
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:35,865
I have a daughter that's completely
opposite from me like this.

237
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:38,505
I enjoy doing, but it taxes me.

238
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,365
So then I'll need a break.

239
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,845
Well, she, if she's at home
all day, she's just go crazy.

240
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,215
Like she just needs to, to get back to.

241
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,555
Volunteering and all over the place.

242
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,655
And that gives her joy, builds her up.

243
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:56,145
So we have to understand ourselves
and the able to prioritize the

244
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,704
things that are important to us.

245
00:15:58,185 --> 00:16:03,525
Michele Butcher-Jones: Very much so that's
like probably well I'll um, I paused on,

246
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:09,885
um, the volunteering about 4:00 AM central
us time, which is about halfway through.

247
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:16,425
And then, um, And who has an interview
later, we'll actually be taking over for

248
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:22,545
moderating all the volunteers and then
I'm passing out and then getting up.

249
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:27,885
And actually my husband and I have
to, um, stay up comedic concerts.

250
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:28,785
We're going to this week.

251
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,540
So after all the hustle and bustle of
getting the WordFest out and completed,

252
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,260
and with a very full workweek this past
two weeks, um, at both jobs, um, have

253
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,030
just been able to have that relaxed time.

254
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:45,750
Yeah.

255
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,050
Cathy Tibbles: Well, we really appreciate
your help and organizing all of us.

256
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,060
It's a bigger job than I think any of us
really realize until we're in your shoes.

257
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,110
So thank you so much.

258
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:21,650
It's a pleasure.
