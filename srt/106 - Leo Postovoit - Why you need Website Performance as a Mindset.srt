53
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,010
I pronounced that correct.

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,980
And he's going to give a session on why.

55
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:23,575
Website performance as a mindset, Leo
heads, product and partnership at XWP.

56
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:28,955

a long time technologist Leo has

57
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:34,325
worked for various publishers,
including San Francisco Chronicle, the

With a background in design marketing
and software engineering, Leo advises

60
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,470
on best practices for usability
deployment and performance, across

many verticals from publishing and
e-commerce to education and nonprofit.

62
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,280
Leo, we are here for you.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,790
Hey everyone.

64
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,414
My name is Leo Postovoit.

65
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,885
I'm head of product strategy
and partnerships, XWP.

66
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:09,625
It is a very early.

67
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,840
5:08 AM.

68
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,489
This is a real live clock.

69
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,749
Uh, this is not some strange recording
from a distant past in the future, uh,

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,169
here in Germany where I am currently
based, but I'm also doing some stuff

71
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,309
in APAC and also, uh, in the US I'm
really excited today to talk to you

72
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,409
about website performance as a mindset.

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520
And also I'm excited to kick off
things here in the Asia session.

74
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:35,239
For WordFest live 2022.

75
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:38,719
So, um, if you have real
questions, I'm a real human being.

76
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,679
It's good to see you all excited to
see everything as we all come together

77
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,109
for this wonderful session here today.

78
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,609
So first things first, I wanted to
talk a little bit about XWP, uh,

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,140
awesome organization that I work with.

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,739
Um, we are focused on building
a better web at enterprise.

81
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,320
So, what this means for us is we
build performance web class with

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,940
world-class solutions for enterprise
media and technology companies.

83
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,980
Um, which means the very best in
technology and the very best sites

84
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,300
that run on that same technology.

85
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,490
And so we work in a variety of verticals
across the web, everything from awesome

86
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,510
publishers to awesome technology
companies, to really cool things in

87
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,300
education and video games and nonprofits.

88
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,660
And.

89
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:25,415
But that's really not what you're
here to talk about, uh, with me today,

90
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,835
what you really want to hear about is
the growth and performance mindset.

91
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:35,525
So as we unpack and understand the ideas
surrounding the web, we want to understand

92
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,745
how we measure what success looks like.

93
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:41,375
So how exactly do we measure success?

94
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:46,865
Well, do you know that that bare metric,
uh, idea performance isn't measurable in a

95
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,655
single number or a single way at a level?

96
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:53,989
You have probably a dozen different
metrics for your organization or

97
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:56,030
your clients even on, on site.

98
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,750
Um, as we unpack this conversation,
you'll see that I'm really trying to

99
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,950
help you have the tools and language
to understand how you'll be able to

100
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,060
engage with your audiences or your site
or your customers in ways that will.

101
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,110
In terms of performance, you might
measure them already around things

102
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,520
like form conversion, checkouts, or
maybe click through rates, sometimes

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,750
organizations even further, and they might
say appointments booked or NPS scores,

104
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,550
costumes, customer success surveys.

105
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,630
I find that.

106
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,935
All of these scores are really
good to useful, but there's a key

107
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,085
metric that seems to come up again
and again with us that we find that

108
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,825
it's really useful for your team.

109
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:37,235
Be able to think about at a high
level, uh, in terms of things you can

110
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,485
do to improve your overall scores.

111
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:44,015
And that is page speed and page
speed and slow loading as a whole.

112
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:47,495
We find that if you don't do this
correctly, you'll have a softer

113
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,935
score across all of these other.

114
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:53,175
So, if you find that your page good
scores are slow through lighthouse

115
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:56,045
are page speed insights or anything
else that you're doing altogether,

116
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,605
you probably should start there.

117
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:59,405
And then we continue
to optimize from there.

118
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:05,255
Um, there was a great study done a
couple of, uh, a couple of years ago

119
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:09,575
now because COVID brain and everything
else as is the other, uh, Deloitte did

120
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:15,245
a wonderful study and, uh, early 2020
that talked about the ideas of what

121
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,435
it meant to optimize for page views.

122
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,185
So when these things come
together, we really think you

123
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,745
need to care about your users.

124
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,810
And what delights said was that if
you give your customers the kind of

125
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,900
experience that exact you'd expect
to watch these customers to be happy,

126
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,489
otherwise they would leave quickly.

127
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,140
And within this, we saw that at
based on a 0.1 second, natural

128
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,950
mobile student group grouping.

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,180
We saw a positive change, the
number of page views version rates.

130
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,349
And in some cases we saw for
just a single 0.1 second.

131
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,970
So a hundred milliseconds in total, we
saw retail conversions increased by 8.4%.

132
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,520
And an average order value is by 9.2.

133
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,760
So pretty substantial as these things go.

134
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,790
Um, in terms of page speed, we
find that if organizations care

135
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,579
about these things, you'll be
able to grow pretty substantially.

136
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,500
Uh, actually people like to call
this as the mindset of these

137
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:07,520
as this is coming together.

138
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,760
So performance is a mindset is
critical because if you can't

139
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,079
identify all the factors that are.

140
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:15,785
You won't be able to make the data
driven decisions that will be able to

141
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:18,545
help you understand what would be able
to make it, make you drive further.

142
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:23,165
So if you can decide what you want
to focus on first, you'll have to

143
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:25,505
ultimately sacrifice the things
that would be helping you along the

144
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:27,065
way, especially in the context of.

145
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,450
Um, another great case study that
we'd like to talk about is a case that

146
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,589
he's done about 10 years ago from an
Austin journal called behavioral and

147
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,910
behavior and information technology.

148
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,800
And so this was done back before
mobile technology was the norm back

149
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,220
before we thought mobile technology
would be the, uh, the standard across.

150
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:50,345
And at the time when people weren't
engaging just with desktops, which

151
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,675
are typically slower as a part of the
experience, they'd found that users

152
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:58,415
will Bandon a webpage bending to
form it 50, 50 milliseconds of delay.

153
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,605
I prevented them being able to engage.

154
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:04,145
And so if we found is that it's
critical for you to focus on eight and

155
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,405
it prevents your users to be happy.

156
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:09,815
So if you're finding that you have 50,
50 milliseconds or more of delay beyond

157
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:13,535
what standards, Hey, you're not going
to be able to engage with users at a

158
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:15,005
high level and you should be tracking.

159
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,310
The numbers from 10 years ago are
just as true as they are today.

160
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,079
And so if your numbers don't meet the
thresholds for critical, do your best.

161
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,159
So as we look at this idea of web
experience, as well as this idea of

162
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,419
content as a whole, we really unpack this
through will be called the four pillars.

163
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,679
So our next WP, we talk about this
four pillar experience as a holistic

164
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,030
look, and that holistic look talks
with the idea of an experiential.

165
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:46,234
So these four experiences, aren't
just focused on any one of these, but

166
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,005
rather they're together interlinked.

167
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,645
Um, and we're going to talk primarily
about page speed, but I've been

168
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:51,995
cooking mentioned the others as well.

169
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:55,954
You spell it out for us as measured
through the concepts of UX and design.

170
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,734
So this is a measurable way of
understanding how easy it is to

171
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,685
engage the webpage conversion.

172
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:07,055
As you probably understand from a forum or
booking journey, something that will tell

173
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:09,185
us whether a user actually did the thing.

174
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:12,004
And retention either.

175
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,065
Are they continuing to come back
to that customer journey experience

176
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:19,024
as we expect them to, or maybe the
second or seven or 12 purchase, right.

177
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:22,655
We want to be able to see are they
doing the things they want to do, but

178
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:26,764
if we were to pinpoint to a single
metric of these four things, the XVP

179
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:30,214
considers to be the sort of critical
elements around Patriot experience.

180
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,494
We see that, I'm sorry.

181
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:34,565
I brought up performance
and the experience, the pain

182
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:35,645
space is the critical element.

183
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:40,355
So what that means for us as to how
long it takes a user to make a request,

184
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,325
to build all this into the background
and deliver that back to that browser.

185
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:48,214
And so if you don't have good page
experience, we will see all, all of

186
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:51,395
these four metrics will be slower
and lower than with like humidity.

187
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:56,135
And so what we find is that if you just
focus on page B, just focus on this

188
00:11:56,135 --> 00:12:00,125
as a starting element, you can do why
the bit to get started with, because.

189
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:04,265
And so page speed, we find
impacts nearly every site metrics.

190
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,525
So also things like conversion,
things like time on site, bounce rate,

191
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:09,724
things that will go even further.

192
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:13,744
And page speed has a ton of
metrics, uh, within these

193
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:15,395
different elements you can pull up.

194
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:20,824
Um, however, we'd like to ideally focus on
just a tiny subset at least a day, because

195
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,354
we know that this has a critical metric,
an oven that's just like to focus on.

196
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:26,465
We talk about these things
as the core website.

197
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:30,935
So the court vitals are a little bit
confusing, but I promise you by the end of

198
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:34,865
the day, stop, we'll be able to help you
understand what you can do to be able to

199
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,635
pull from a further level of what's there.

200
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:42,005
So, uh, Google defines the core
bottles as a framework to measure

201
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,805
your users page speed experience.

202
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,765
Um, that sounds like a big
topic, but I promise you it's

203
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,025
relatively straightforward.

204
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:52,805
So previously before 2020.

205
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,730
Things such as time to first bite,
especially in the context of posting

206
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,060
or first Contentful paint, which
is how quickly it'll take to load

207
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,030
something on the screen or the time
to interact in that amount of time.

208
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,880
It takes to load all those obstacles on
the page and get all thinking right there.

209
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,010
Well, Google bot and Chrome and other
power special up to 200 different

210
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,370
metrics of a pace speed, uh, on
a site as well as all the other.

211
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,535
Each of these different elements
are kind of confusing because

212
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:21,785
there's a lot of things that seem
to overlap on top of each other.

213
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:25,145
And it's hard to say, well, whether
it a good FCP will provide a good

214
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,435
experience, if ultimately you want it.

215
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:29,795
I use it to interact after
all, a lot of discussion.

216
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:32,555
Google came together inside of the
three metrics, the large screen

217
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:36,095
temporal paint, the first input delay
and the creative layout shift are

218
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,314
actually the three critical things
you probably should be focusing on.

219
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,885
And I know this is going to sound
a little bit confusing because

220
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,045
there's a lot of numbers of lumps
from a purchase we're talking about.

221
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,350
But let's talk about this from the user
perspective, because users ultimately

222
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,430
will tell us what you want to do.

223
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,240
And from a user perspective, we
like to think about, you know, the

224
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,740
idea of core vitals, uh, to be happy
and loyal, want users to be happy

225
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,390
and engaged with our platforms.

226
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,360
We want project product managers
who are building platforms with

227
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,000
us, or with websites, thus, we'll
be talking about, yes, there's you

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,090
have to be in future customers or
happy, or, Hey, should we feature?

229
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,250
Africans are happy or
Hey should be feature.

230
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,390
And our suppliers are happy.

231
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,459
We'll want to be ultimately
trying to move things on.

232
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,900
Developers really like to see if
the core vitals as a meaningful

233
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,740
metric that is actually measurable
in a neutral way across all sites.

234
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,340
If you have good fast scores and
everyone's happy, then executives,

235
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,040
of course, who are paying for these
types of things are looking to monitor

236
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,450
these things in terms of success.

237
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,370
So this is, that's an
opportunity for business growth.

238
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,770
All of these three metrics.

239
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,990
Let's talk about what they
mean and how we define them.

240
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,200
So with LCP, we're focusing on.

241
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,820
At a basic level we want to define
is the thing that we want to see

242
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,770
actually loading in an efficient way.

243
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,219
Uh, if LCP is a lower than 2.5 seconds
threshold, we know that load is too

244
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:57,320
slow for what users are expecting in
terms of FID we're expecting for the

245
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,270
first interaction that a user wants.

246
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,810
So in this case, we have an example of
a user trying to interact with a search

247
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,459
widget or perhaps on a menu or a back
button, whatever it might be on that given

248
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,320
application, especially in the context of.

249
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:14,225
If the application is not responsive
and a facet of experience,

250
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,905
the user is going to leave.

251
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:19,835
And the public one to build a bad trust
that experts is there in terms of FID,

252
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,855
we're expecting at least a hundred
millisecond response or faster to be able

253
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,415
to determine what's going to be good.

254
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:29,105
And the most egregious I
like to call out is CLS.

255
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,375
So you probably have experienced this,
this one's at some point in your, and

256
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,885
your time on the internet, you've been
trying to go to cancel button, but

257
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:37,505
instead you actually ended up hitting.

258
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,394
And depending on the submit button
by mistake, this is because that CLS

259
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:45,394
has this idea of positioning where
things don't necessarily line up.

260
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,604
So perhaps you're trying to engage
with content, but you see an ad.

261
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:49,775
Maybe you want to click.

262
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:50,134
Yes.

263
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,455
But you see no that the simple.

264
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,740
We don't want you to experience
things that are ultimately driving

265
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,180
you down the wrong direction.

266
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,370
So of these three things, we find that
if you have a good LCP, so a really

267
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,500
fast loading site in low FID and easy
to interact with score that allows you

268
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,550
to interact with the application and
the low CLS where they lay out does

269
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,750
not shift very frequently and very low
altogether within the page painting,

270
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,459
you have a good experience there.

271
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:21,935
And so, uh, across the board, one of
our key partners, Google, we worked with

272
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:26,225
last five or six years at this point,
we've seen that they've seen incredible

273
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,594
growth, uh, with various customers.

274
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:33,604
So on this first example with G
I G E D I a group, a editorial

275
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:39,035
publisher out of Italy, they saw an
incredible increase, um, with these

276
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,675
types of scores by decreasing CLSC.

277
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,760
So by increasing these things we
saw in major increase in basic

278
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,930
performance, things that were there.

279
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,150
So by decreasing CLS, we saw that
people didn't leave a site sending,

280
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,820
uh, Lazada, a Singapore based site.

281
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,709
We saw by decreasing LCP.

282
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,390
We saw an increase in conversion rate
by 17%, pretty high scoring us there.

283
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,320
And then, yeah, which I believe
is a, um, a Korean website.

284
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,460
We saw a decrease of LCP with an
increase of the rate by a hundred.

285
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,260
So pretty powerful scores that we're
able to increase over time with a

286
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,540
certain amount of focus on metrics.

287
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,070
So if need, ultimately try to improve
these basic scores, we should see at

288
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,090
basic increase in engagement, but that's
bounce rate conversion rate, click

289
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,500
through rate three different metrics.

290
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,840
You might measure it in terms
of success for your given.

291
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:35,480
Well, Y one of the things at a
basic level is that core vitals

292
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,830
are about user engagement.

293
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,980
They're not just measurements of
what it's pinned on the page, but

294
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,649
there are other focused on the
things that will show when users.

295
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:47,435
So if you ultimately delay content,
when it doesn't allow users to engage,

296
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,804
people will ultimately get away quickly.

297
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,565
We also find that in terms
of publishing content.

298
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,955
So this is typically focused on new
sites, but it does apply to blog sites.

299
00:17:56,344 --> 00:18:00,605
The huge sector within WordPress, we found
that people will, will no longer engage

300
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:01,565
them as that we're expecting for them.

301
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,514
And they give good scores.

302
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:07,565
We usually see a 23% lower
abandonment rate in those sites

303
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,734
with excellence, core models.

304
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:10,444
That's what we're after.

305
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:13,435
We want people to be engaging and to be
happy with the content they're getting.

306
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,455
So all of a sudden done, I think it's
tips of Google are great for you,

307
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:21,995
but how does that actually matter
for your, your website, your site?

308
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,815
It's probably running on WordPress
and really focused on content.

309
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:31,205
Well, you distill this down to three best
practices, uh, and primarily paid speed

310
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,565
being our main guidance, because we think
that's probably the first thing you need

311
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:38,435
to care about because it seems that like
most sites today, for some reason on the

312
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,444
web don't care as much as they could.

313
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:45,125
First, we want you to understand
your current state of your

314
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,444
site or multiple sites of.

315
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:48,020
Second.

316
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,279
We want you to evaluate that and determine
how you get your use with the need.

317
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,060
And then third, we want you to
ultimately transform and to treat

318
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,710
performance as your long-term goal.

319
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,940
So within these three, we're going to
spend a couple of minutes here going

320
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,750
through each of these processes to
determine the best practice of how we

321
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,009
ultimately shift these things forward.

322
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,219
So first, do you actually understand your
current state of your websites before.

323
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,929
Um, we use a variety of tools, uh,
that we think are really useful.

324
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,270
So one of them we find
that's really critical.

325
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,900
It's free.

326
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,290
It's easy to do is a tool
called page speed insights.

327
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,030
So Patriot insights is probably our main
tool because it's a neutral heuristic.

328
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,440
Anyone can use this.

329
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:35,150
It's a self hosted, sorry, a cloud
hosted version of lighthouse, uh, on

330
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,830
the web that who uses that you can,
uh, mutually determine a score based

331
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,000
on the improvements of lab data.

332
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,925
And also synergizes some data from crux,
the crumb user experience apart, and will

333
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:49,085
tell us about how fast the website is.

334
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:52,205
We have a couple of other tools
with the are really critical, like

335
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:54,784
Google search console will tell
you about errors and warnings.

336
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:59,134
Google analytics will tell you about how
successful you are getting to certain

337
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:01,864
goals within the site and how you navigate
through these different things that are

338
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:05,915
there to Libra, which we find is really
useful for determining the overall

339
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:10,594
health within a site and the lab scores
across over time and new Relic, which

340
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:11,614
should tell you about server performance.

341
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:16,715
Ultimately, we want to be able to
determine a good set of lab scores

342
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,154
and a good set of, uh, uh, real
user metrics scores, field scores.

343
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:25,445
If you will, within this, we want
you to ultimately measure good

344
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,085
grades, but also aim for results.

345
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:32,945
You want to find how far gets
and to continue to move along.

346
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,549
So of all of these though, there's
a lot of tools we've talked about.

347
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,250
The one I'll mention
again, is page insights.

348
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:44,060
So the nice thing about business,
that it's a Google hosted lighthouse

349
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,980
scoring that as relatively neutral.

350
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,090
So if you poke and prod at this, and
here's an example of xDB the site

351
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,330
that we help maintain, you'll see
that we've got a pretty good score.

352
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,790
It's because we spent a lot of time
caring and concerning ourselves

353
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,070
with what our users are seeking in.

354
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,310
The wild that field data is based
off of real users and what they're

355
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,179
actually seeing in the wild.

356
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:06,815
The overall lab score will be helpful
to determine and tell you like how

357
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,165
far along the way you've gotten.

358
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,844
Uh, but ultimately if your scores are
good, it's like getting too many results.

359
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:16,114
If your at scores are low, though,
it's going to give you a huge set

360
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:17,554
of actionable recommendations.

361
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,614
For example, can you improve the
way your fonts are delivered?

362
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,975
Can you improve the way your media is
delivered in terms of images or videos?

363
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:25,955
There's a lot you can do typically.

364
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:31,505
Even more so though, if you haven't
actually paid attention to a

365
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:34,715
basic concept of user experience,
so take your actual phone.

366
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:36,395
And so for me here, it's 5.48.

367
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,534
And again, it's a real time.

368
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:41,495
I'm here in a live conversation
with Hugh out here with you,

369
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,505
uh, for work best live 2022.

370
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,445
You want to actually
examine what your users are.

371
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:51,725
So, if you see that your users
are getting lots of ads and the

372
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,705
concept of getting is a headline.

373
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:57,574
So here is a pretty terrible
example of a fake news experience

374
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,344
where the headline is cut off.

375
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:04,205
And we have an ad above an ad
above a newsletter, above a prompt.

376
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,304
We install and install the app button.

377
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:06,975
Right?

378
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:09,574
Pretty typical of the experience
you're getting across the web.

379
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:10,565
We don't want.

380
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,020
At a basic level, similar to the
principles of agile, the agile manifesto.

381
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,589
Many years ago, we care more
about content than advertisements.

382
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,049
We care more about integration
and attraction that we do

383
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,399
about prompts and distraction.

384
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,909
We care more about delightful
experiences than we do about conversion.

385
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:29,480
If you create experiences that people
want to engage with the things they're

386
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,440
presenting, then people are probably
going to more likely to present themselves

387
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,879
with the corn twins use to practice.

388
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,150
So, if you can focus on your user, as
opposed to your conversion goal, the

389
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,830
user will more likely one to convert.

390
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:47,210
And if you fail the critical task of
ultimately getting the user, what they

391
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,400
came for, they're going to abandon.

392
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,270
And if they abandoned nothing
else matters, you failed on a

393
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,409
basic premise of what you can do.

394
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,699
So if you aren't doing a good enough
job being introspective on what

395
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,889
things are there, then you use,
those are likely going to leave.

396
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,880
And we think that's a critical thing you
should be doing as a review of all of

397
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,969
your sites, of all events you're touching
you could be doing in front of you.

398
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,389
Um, well that's the
first part of us, right?

399
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,790
In terms of content, we probably also
want to consider the other elements of.

400
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,409
Um, I'm going to list here.

401
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,589
Just four things we thought over the
last couple of years are critical

402
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:22,460
for you to pay attention to.

403
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,429
So for products that we've ultimately
worked on over the last few years,

404
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,609
that we think can help with these
things along the way, if you thought

405
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,580
with the content journey, at least
for our some awesome plugins that

406
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,529
are free and widely available across.

407
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,590
The first is jet pack boost.

408
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,199
So this is a free plugin
that helps you with improving

409
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,520
CSS and JavaScript delivery.

410
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,210
The second is the amp for WordPress
plugin, which helps things like, um,

411
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,870
providing critical CSS, uh, within
the webpage, uh, that your ultimate.

412
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:52,565
Google scikit-learn should provide in-page
analysis in terms of the things you're

413
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:57,214
doing for analytics, pretty powerful
tool built in, uh, to a lot of different

414
00:23:57,214 --> 00:24:01,174
aspects of WordPress and the PWA plugin,
which makes progressive web as possible to

415
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:05,495
do things like offline node and a backer
and rendering a content in fast way.

416
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,455
All of these performance related
plugins can take your experience

417
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:12,395
even further if you paid attention
to that experience of style.

418
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:16,205
So give your users what they want
as early and often as possible.

419
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:16,534
You can be.

420
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,940
So after hearing all of this, how
do you make sure this is going

421
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,259
to happen over the longterm?

422
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:25,210
Well, it becomes about strategy.

423
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,839
You no longer need to worry about
the remediation problem, but rather

424
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,190
the strategic long-term problem.

425
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,600
So the elegant experiments should be
ultimately focused on the realities

426
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,319
of technology and, you know, uh,
in an era where we're trying to

427
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,000
be conservative around energy.

428
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:44,940
You consider it that lower bandwidth and
also lower processing power means that

429
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,650
your users will get a faster experience.

430
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,549
If you could consider it, the ultimate
render that experiences, that means

431
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,049
less better that's being consumed.

432
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:52,830
It means less network.

433
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,770
Topic is less storage, all
that content and data it's.

434
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,810
Ultimately all the users are
getting a faster experience.

435
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,620
In addition to this, one of our, one
of my favorite, uh, colleagues, uh,

436
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,270
Mike , one of our lead, uh, front
end developers spends a lot of time

437
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,440
with, but this idea of cognitive.

438
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:11,870
If you have a smaller, simpler,
faster initial paint, your users

439
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,659
will experience a much more lighter
experience at mobile expected.

440
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,389
Meaning don't load all
the stuff above the fold.

441
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:20,630
Don't cram all the things that
are there, give your users the

442
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,190
experience to expecting, right?

443
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:25,639
If you give your users experience are
going to engage, but if you give them

444
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,250
a negative experience, they're going
to bounce as quickly as possible.

445
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,270
We don't want the.

446
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,165
Going one step further.

447
00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:36,844
What we've found is that everyone
on your team probably cares what

448
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,495
the idea of performance results.

449
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:42,545
This means conversion, retention, page
experience, and so on and so forth.

450
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:46,505
So if you haven't actually considered
what your engineers are thinking

451
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:50,495
about, when you're preparing a design,
you're failing at a default setting

452
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:54,304
to be true under or now analysts
or SEO, NRLS, talk to your team.

453
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,114
Who's focusing on this.

454
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:59,839
You want to ultimately design
with performance rules in mind to

455
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,750
ultimately consider how your scores
will improve over the long run.

456
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,799
You want to be rerunning your
test early and often and consider

457
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,080
how you can ultimately improve
those experiences over there.

458
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,080
Meaning if you ship a feature
and you haven't rerun those

459
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,690
tests, you don't know if that's
actually going to help you or her.

460
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:18,275
And sometimes the feature you thought
was going to be good might actually

461
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:21,005
do the opposite or maybe not be
as big as you thought it would be.

462
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:25,205
So we find that you need to not
just measure them once, rather than

463
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,495
considering them over the long-term.

464
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:31,085
And also not just measure things
in terms of initial page views, per

465
00:26:31,085 --> 00:26:33,725
se, but also consider conversion
metrics across the board.

466
00:26:33,964 --> 00:26:34,205
Right.

467
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:35,915
So consider the entire lens.

468
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:36,935
What things will work by.

469
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,449
And the idea of the
long-term goals are critical.

470
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,600
If you ultimately consider what
is the metrics look like over the

471
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,590
proactive long-term metrics, you can
ultimately be doing things that will

472
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,120
help you feel good about these things.

473
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,650
So the one funnels we talked about
are focused on user research and these

474
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,460
user research metrics are focused on
what's considered natural, according

475
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,920
to the researchers at Google, and
then the positions I've thought

476
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,360
about there's metrics locally across.

477
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,460
And as the goalposts move, we want
you to be focusing on continuing

478
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,110
to make them obsessed even faster.

479
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,460
So you can optimize with performance
mindset across the board website would

480
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,199
be lighter, more nimble across the board.

481
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,360
So at a basic level, if you're given a
choice to remove the barrier in a way,

482
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,040
your customers wouldn't you do it again.

483
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,610
The hardest part is the research which
Google and other hospitalizations across

484
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,409
the board with the white have done.

485
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,070
So listen to the research and focus
on what you can do about getting.

486
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,300
So all things said and done.

487
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,330
I have a couple of items for you to
think back to your teams or maybe

488
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,960
onto your website and to be asking
about what we can do to improve

489
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,460
the overall performance website.

490
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,150
So the first thing you should be
doing is at least the measuring

491
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:48,590
things in terms of page speed.

492
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,590
And if you haven't actually done
a good job in understanding your

493
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,400
current state, your page speed start.

494
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,960
So we're view this with the tools
we talked about earlier at a

495
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,580
basic level of using lab tests.

496
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,469
Like the ones we talked
about as well as field data.

497
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,800
So you can use Patriot insights,
Patriot insights, reveals

498
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,699
a little bit of crux data.

499
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,290
You also pull the press reports directly
and give your users what they need.

500
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,400
So at a bare, bare, bare minimum,
consider meaning the industry best

501
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,500
practices, thresholds, or performance.

502
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:18,320
We also want to talk about
other things too, right?

503
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,259
So not just support vitals
are probably considered a time

504
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,280
interactive and time before.

505
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,745
Time interactive is, is important
because if you've bought lots of

506
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,415
third-party JavaScript loading
your page, it's probably providing

507
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,315
a pretty negative experience.

508
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:31,175
It's their time to first bite.

509
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:34,185
It's also critical because if you haven't
considered how the hosting experience

510
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:37,625
folds into these things with lots of PHP,
for example, a floating in the background,

511
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:39,665
it's going to end up hurting your scores.

512
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:43,054
You should be considered things like
object caching, or perhaps a better host.

513
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,145
If you haven't done the things, the
correct way to ultimately improve

514
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:47,165
the experience across the board.

515
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,614
Next up, we also want to talk
about conversion rate metrics.

516
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:55,264
If you don't get Christian metrics are
lower than Israel, we're expecting do

517
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:58,745
more to improve it and see what you
can do to match those best practices.

518
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:01,775
And if you haven't done a good enough job,
there's more, you probably can be doing.

519
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:06,275
And if by any sense, you haven't
actually met these metrics.

520
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:09,425
We want you to go back and
focus on mediation before you

521
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,655
move into the long-term, etc.

522
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:14,255
Finally, in the blonde combined
set goals, we want you to talk

523
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:17,525
about this idea is a basic level
of what we could do with property.

524
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,859
So as you ship a new feature, as
you ship a new update, whatever it

525
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:26,299
might be, you should be acting on
this idea of how we can improve these

526
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,830
integration experiences across the board.

527
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,639
Have you actually done a good enough
job to determine whether you'd

528
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:32,989
be retesting the scores across.

529
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:38,900
And over the long-term, what we've seen
is that Google and other organizations

530
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:43,489
being and so on have actually measured
the scores in different ways over time.

531
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:47,719
So at core vitals ships, the new
feature, which we know that was mentioned

532
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,610
a couple of times have less fence.

533
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:50,929
How will you respond to.

534
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:54,475
So at the goalpost moves
are requires new things.

535
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:58,134
You'll ultimately want to be measuring
new things along the way for these

536
00:29:58,134 --> 00:29:59,784
page page experience metrics.

537
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:03,415
So this approach we've talked about is
relatively neutral, regardless of what

538
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,944
page experience metrics are measuring for.

539
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:09,174
But the idea of caring about your users
is the consistent part of the seasons.

540
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:12,529
So all that sudden done.

541
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,159
I want to say thank you for all coming
today to talk about this awesome, uh,

542
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:22,370
topic here at the Big Orange Heart,
uh, session at WordFest live 2022.

543
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,949
And I'm going to move into questions.

544
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,860
If anyone here in the audience
has any questions for us.

545
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,569
Leo Postovoit: Hello?

546
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,100
Hello.

547
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,819
Yogesh Londhe: Hey, thank you very
much for that amazing session.

548
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:44,270
And, uh, Yours was the first
station in Asia region and a

549
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,620
very, very good morning to you.

550
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,199
Did you have your coffee or not yet?

551
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,179
Leo Postovoit: I I've had a tea.

552
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,150
It was a delicious turmeric tea.

553
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,620
Yogesh Londhe: Wow.

554
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,889
Wow.

555
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:58,500
Well tell me, tell me
tea and a good t-shirt.

556
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:03,094
Leo Postovoit: Yes, unfortunately cleaned.

557
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:05,884
Okay.

558
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:08,465
Uh, so, uh, yep.

559
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:09,364
Hi Lux.

560
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:12,455
And, um, so we got a
few questions for you,

561
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:16,685
Lax Mariappan: uh, before, you know

562
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:20,705
Yogesh Londhe: yeah, of course there
will be ma many questions for you

563
00:31:20,705 --> 00:31:25,835
from, you know, once you enter the
community tent or something, But,

564
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,695
uh, we'll take a few questions here.

565
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:28,895
Okay.

566
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:32,525
Uh, you discussed a lot of
important points and it was

567
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:33,915
very comprehensive the talk.

568
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:38,344
Could you discuss this
lighthouse score and that, uh,

569
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,534
Chrome user experience score?

570
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:42,335
Uh, what is the.

571
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:47,344
Can you compare them and what does
each one should, tell us more?

572
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:47,764
Yeah.

573
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:49,145
Yeah.

574
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:53,585
Leo Postovoit: So lighthouse is the
name of a tool that comes with Chrome,

575
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,565
Google Chrome, inside your browser.

576
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:58,864
It's a tool that you can set
up and we'll run on instance.

577
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:03,094
So lighthouse measure is a tool
based on whatever the environment is.

578
00:32:03,784 --> 00:32:06,844
Lighthouse can be measured
with a specific set of frames.

579
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,969
So you can measure it as a mobile
score or based on network conditions.

580
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,889
Um, it would be very different if running
5g network conditions on a, you know, a

581
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:23,000
nine core, sorry, an eight core or 20 know
28 core computer in a major developed city

582
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,520
versus the same one in an emerging market.

583
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,699
Those different scores are critical
because we won't understand

584
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:29,779
what those things look like.

585
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,739
A small device with low spec hardware
is completely different experience

586
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,389
measuring a device on an aspect.

587
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:39,500
Um, also we find is that
it's a reality of a problem.

588
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,550
So as I said earlier on in the meeting
here, I'm currently based in Germany, we

589
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,389
actually have terrible internet and what
the city that I've been now, I love it.

590
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,880
But in reality, I actually have
slower internet here than I've

591
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,320
had in certain developing markets.

592
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,590
That reality of what it's like
to be and even inner cities.

593
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,550
So what that means is that I'm
getting, um, 2, 3, 4 minute bits

594
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,130
down, which is slower than you
might find in certain cities.

595
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,100
So even though network conditions
I'm at currently, even in the

596
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,179
idea of a so-called developed.

597
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,435
You might find that you have these
spotty connections and having things

598
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:11,525
like Peter ways or having reconnect
or other features that are there.

599
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,045
These ultimately provide a
faster experiences there.

600
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:18,154
So lighthouse tries to mimic the
experience of not being on a perfect

601
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:22,565
condition and crux measures the
experience of your users in the wild.

602
00:33:22,654 --> 00:33:25,475
In fact, one of the things we're doing
right now, actually BP is trying to

603
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:29,194
explain the idea of your Chrome user
experience report in terms of what

604
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:30,964
your users being, seeing in the wild.

605
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,935
And so Google measures this idea of a 75%.

606
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:38,634
So of all your users on a bell curve,
the seventh, the percentiles, what did

607
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,804
they actually see as the real score?

608
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:44,614
So sometimes your lab's quarter and
lighthouse, especially on mobile,

609
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:49,174
especially on inspect hardware on mixed
network traffic, you might find that it's

610
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:52,565
actually faster than your users or even
slower than users, depending on locations.

611
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:56,014
Look like if that score is different
than your crux, use the scores,

612
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,714
you're not measuring for how your
users are experiencing those things.

613
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:03,795
So if you find that your scores are faster
or slower than your crock scores, go get

614
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:07,295
advice, go see what things are looking
like in that actual number, condition and

615
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,615
experience what it's like to be there.

616
00:34:08,855 --> 00:34:11,855
So this means building ads
or loading a web video.

617
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,165
It might be looked experienced
these things together.

618
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:16,565
We want to see what these things
are actually like in the wild.

619
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:19,385
And in fact, I'll give them going
one step further and say that

620
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:21,125
your lab scores don't matter.

621
00:34:21,455 --> 00:34:24,185
Your crux scores and your real
user measured scores matter unit.

622
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:27,545
Um, one of the things I'll call
up a real user metrics because

623
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:28,565
it's pretty much mentioned.

624
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:33,065
We use a tool at Sopp that actually
attaches your real users scores

625
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:36,305
in the wild, and it passes that as
a parameter for Google of licks.

626
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,705
So there's a couple of techniques on
the wild, where you can read about this.

627
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:41,375
You can pass through your
growing vitals as an accustom

628
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,695
parameter into Google analytics.

629
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:47,135
It makes it much easier to have
this as real user metric data as

630
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,515
part of each individual session.

631
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:51,275
So you want to be ultimately seeing
what you're used to seeing in the wild.

632
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:52,565
Otherwise you're not doing the right.

633
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:58,925
Well, that was a very
elaborate and very good answer.

634
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:03,005
So when you talking, I was, uh,
I know it brought back memories

635
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:05,345
of some of my own clients.

636
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:11,465
They came up with, they had this legacy,
what pre-site and, uh, some agency had

637
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:18,875
developed a custom theme and they had
a few Krause's too many on the front.

638
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:25,070
And you don't like the
front page loading time.

639
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:32,450
It was very long, but, uh, they had,
they had a loyal followers, so they had a

640
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:37,880
very good hips and they didn't know much
about Google analytics school and they

641
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,890
didn't know the Google console, nothing.

642
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,759
So I installed that Google
analytics and showed them that

643
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,570
they are getting not a fish from
around the world because you are.

644
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:52,145
Children's publishing
site and that was popular.

645
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:58,895
But, uh, the problem was they were
getting, um, investors and investors

646
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:03,274
had a few engineers and they were,
they wanted technical details.

647
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:09,515
They wanted, uh, the page speed
and they know the first rendered

648
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:10,924
object and all those things.

649
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:12,125
They, they were looking for that.

650
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:15,964
So that was, it brought, brought
back memories of all that,

651
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,285
uh, when you were talking.

652
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,529
Let's do you want to
take the next question?

653
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,700
Yes.

654
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,410
Uh, so you said about, uh, for
example, you read the, you make sure

655
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,240
you, you, where you read that popular
article from smashing magazine about

656
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,310
the, uh, it's a recent one, right?

657
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,770
I think January or something like, so they
talked about the field data and they found

658
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,660
out, even though they are like a static
site, like they, they found out that they

659
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,000
had more audience from India and India.

660
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:53,345
Poor internet connection and that give
them like, um, the goal replied a lot.

661
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:58,085
Their scores were less, uh, even though
they're the tech stack or everything

662
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,945
was pretty optimized and it's good.

663
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,775
So, um, my question.

664
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:05,165
Um, so you're smashing
magazine is a popular site.

665
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,235
Like a lot of visitors are going there.

666
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:11,585
Let's say if someone like a lot of people
who come to WordPress are affiliate

667
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:14,645
site owners, niche, blogs, or whatever.

668
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:18,725
So if I'm going to launch a new
site, I may not have the field data.

669
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:19,025
Right.

670
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:23,525
I may have just the page
speed insights, lab data.

671
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:25,295
So what's your take on that?

672
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:26,795
Like what advice would you do?

673
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:31,235
Like I should go wait for field
data or just lab data is fine.

674
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,960
How do take it from there.

675
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,220
Yeah.

676
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,200
So a lot to unpack there.

677
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,370
First things first, I think it's
a core responsibility of every

678
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,990
website to be tracking real
field data as much as possible.

679
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,520
So crux is fine.

680
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,600
The crux is 30 days late plus 30
days on top of that, it's really,

681
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,860
really slow to get back to you.

682
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,820
Things that aren't useful.

683
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,250
So Google analytics is.

684
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,615
Um, Hotjar is great.

685
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:57,785
New Relic is great.

686
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:59,675
And there's a ton of other
tools that are there as well.

687
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,815
You want to be ultimately measuring to see
what your users are getting in the wild.

688
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,505
And so as you try things and any
different hospice, we want to see

689
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:10,985
how far you can get to ultimately see
what you can do from those scores.

690
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:14,525
So you need real numbers to tell you
whether you're doing a good thing

691
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:16,325
or bad thing, or a neutral thing.

692
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,635
We don't, we don't necessarily know
if it's a good or bad thing, always.

693
00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:18,965
Right.

694
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,125
Um, first things, first scores
and measurement has to be valid.

695
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:29,360
Um, as a, at a high level, we
want to, um, consider what field

696
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,950
data means across the board.

697
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,070
Um, I find that, uh, it's a
really interesting problem.

698
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,910
So if we talk about a website
in a traditional big Western

699
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,680
city, so a city say like one day.

700
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:44,025
Cisco or Los Angeles or New York
we've done that scores are faster

701
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,735
than the lab scores in field data.

702
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,465
But occasionally we find that
the opposite problem is true.

703
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:51,705
Um, we actually just started
applying at XRP a couple of days ago.

704
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:54,825
Really interesting site that has a 97 97.

705
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:59,855
That actually has slower scores on
lab because of how these things work.

706
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,674
So sometimes the problem is actually
an inverted problem as well.

707
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:07,115
Um, we know that that lab data isn't
actually relevant for measuring what

708
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:11,404
real users are seeing well, and if we
know that algorithms are measuring the

709
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:16,024
70 percentile as a concern, the question
is what are your users experiencing?

710
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,754
And are you using that as a real
metric to guide you what you want?

711
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,275
So I'll say it one step further.

712
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:24,485
You need to be ultimately trying
to ship code and ship features

713
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:27,305
that are going to improve what
your users are getting in the pile.

714
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:31,895
The vast majority of users, according
to Google, it's 70% say 5% of your

715
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:34,565
total Comodo users across the board.

716
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:38,555
And, uh, and the cases of, you know,
India being a really critical, uh,

717
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,055
concern within smashing magazine.

718
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:43,444
I would say that special magazine
probably should have a geo cluster

719
00:39:43,444 --> 00:39:48,295
for is at CDN within India or a
close region and doing a better job.

720
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:48,575
What's that?

721
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:51,444
And ask them the question, can
they reduce their CSS size?

722
00:39:51,444 --> 00:39:54,325
Can they offer an alternate style
sheet, anything to ultimately buy

723
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,585
a faster experience it's there.

724
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:58,435
And I'm willing to bet that
there's a ton more they can do.

725
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,855
Um, and we've actually not talked to the
special magazine team XVP, but if they

726
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:04,615
want to talk to us about how maybe we
can play faster, I can almost guarantee

727
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,134
you, we can make it even faster and you
can be even better for the audience.

728
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,665
We know this is where
you can do within that.

729
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,095
Um, and we can squeeze
out even more, right?

730
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:14,214
So it's, it's a worthy pursuit
and we know that helps with

731
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:15,025
conversion across the board.

732
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,570
Yogesh Londhe: Hey.

733
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,259
Great.

734
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,220
Thank you very much.

735
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:20,900
Yeah.

736
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,529
Great.

737
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,430
Okay.

738
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,750
So next question.

739
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:29,660
Um, you discussed this in your talk,
so let's discuss the delightful

740
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,970
experiences versus conversion from this
different aspects, from the aspect of

741
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,670
the users and users who are visiting
your website, the website owner

742
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,459
developer, and sometimes the investors.

743
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,089
Leo Postovoit: Yeah.

744
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:51,470
So, um, in terms of delightful
experiences, I would say that we want

745
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,540
these things to feel smooth and natural.

746
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,150
So one critical part of how
we approach the problem.

747
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,020
The next to the BP is that we identify
each persona and then we name them.

748
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,560
We say, one is Bob, what is Jim
was Joe, or might be, we want

749
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,610
to navigate through the experts.

750
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:09,185
So a user might have a different
experience if they're on their mobile

751
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:13,415
device, again, on a train, on a bus,
navigating through a place maybe on

752
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:17,105
terrible hotel wifi, um, you never know
what your experience is going to be

753
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:18,875
compared to what someone else's view.

754
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:21,335
Um, and sometimes it's
actually really funny, right?

755
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:22,025
So maybe.

756
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:25,425
Especially in this ecosystem
here, we might have heard about

757
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:29,385
the client stakeholder who was on
internet Explorer, 11 on a computer.

758
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:32,295
That's like many years out of
date, but they happen to be, you

759
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:33,345
know, they hold the purse strings.

760
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,565
They happen to be the most
important person at the company.

761
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:37,155
And maybe they're really senior.

762
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:39,495
And you know, it has nothing
to do with developing markets.

763
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:40,035
Shop is good.

764
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,055
That's the stakeholder.

765
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:42,975
You have to ultimately shape your answer.

766
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:43,485
What's there.

767
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:46,635
Delightful experience is a
true question of all of your

768
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:47,925
users and each of your users.

769
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,750
Sometimes it's that strange one-off
example of a a hundred percent or like

770
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,780
an investor other times, it's going to
be the question of you're both users.

771
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,640
What I find is critical is your users
need to be the things you measure by that.

772
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,175
So, So consider that entire bell curve
that you've got and make that experience

773
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:08,315
be as reliable and elegant as possible.

774
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,115
And not just some random anecdote.

775
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,735
In fact, I would say the investor that's
on nine 11, as much as he might care

776
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,145
about the considerations that are there.

777
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,655
I would say Google's idea of centile,
all the things that are there matter even

778
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:23,225
more, that's the cohort you want to care
about and to do more than an audience.

779
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:26,825
Yogesh Londhe: Great.

780
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:29,375
Uh, okay Lex, you got a.

781
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:34,905
You have a question for the Leo ? I, I,

782
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:42,065
Lax Mariappan: yeah, so, uh, uh, it
just, no matter how, so just a simple

783
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:45,395
question though, like you answered
already, like let's summarize, we have

784
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:49,655
another two minutes left or so it's like,
uh, how can I make my website faster?

785
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:51,485
It's come to everyone's mind.

786
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:53,315
So your question, your answer.

787
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:53,435
Be.

788
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:58,505
Leo Postovoit: Yeah, TLDR you
somehow managed totune in for only

789
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:03,045
section high Leo from XWP, run your
site through a page speed insights

790
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:06,845
or similar tool, pay attention to
recommendations, probably install

791
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,435
plugin that makes your website faster.

792
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:09,965
That's probably not going to be enough.

793
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:12,635
You'd probably want to remove stuff,
actually pay attention to what your

794
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:14,825
releases are doing and do even more.

795
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,825
Your real users are probably going
to be different than we expected, and

796
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,055
you probably can do even more than.

797
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,520
So this is going to be, you know,
optimizing video, forensic images,

798
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,240
throwing fonts, and asking the questions
around letter blocking experiences.

799
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,820
We want you to lighten everything, right?

800
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,040
So, um, I I'll mention a quote from the
great team out of the UK many, many years

801
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,900
ago in the 1960s, it seems from Lotus.

802
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,270
I said, simplify, and then add lightness.

803
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,500
That's how you win races.

804
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:39,890
Right?

805
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,330
So consider that for your website.

806
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,160
Is there a faster way for you to do it?

807
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,480
Well, the answer is probably.

808
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,090
Lax Mariappan: Yep.

809
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,750
Yes.

810
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:54,350
So I can just take it as a performance
is a process, not just plug it, right?

811
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:54,980
Leo Postovoit: Yeah.

812
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,960
It's a hundred percent.

813
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:56,090
Yes.

814
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:56,810
Yogesh Londhe: Yeah.

815
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,530
A hundred percent.

816
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,350
So, uh, yeah, I think let's
take one more question.

817
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,260
I'll I'll combine few more, few things.

818
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,230
So, you know, we are
talking about performance.

819
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:14,080
So once we have a website, a WordPress
site, so should I have AMP or PWA?

820
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:15,765
The AMP or PWA.

821
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:21,515
And then can you go ahead and
tell us, uh, how does CDN affect

822
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,195
any of those two are without the.

823
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,370
Leo Postovoit: Man.

824
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:30,290
I don't have enough time to answer the
question, but I would say, I would say

825
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,540
about, uh, after they experience update
in, uh, last year, amp is still a useful

826
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,240
thing, but it's shifting in a different
way, but for customer page has been,

827
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,650
so it's there, first of all, I'm up.

828
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,850
So I focused on in sambal technologies
and offline a lot you can do within PWAs.

829
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,070
Um, I think he was just, don't be useful.

830
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,950
I would also say the CDNs are
great, but you have to measure

831
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,120
where your real users are.

832
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,700
And if that's, again is
ultimately going to help.

833
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:56,535
Um, what we find, for example, um, we work
a lot with customers that are in Asia,

834
00:44:56,595 --> 00:45:00,255
for example, uh, things like Singapore
or China or India, there's sometimes

835
00:45:00,255 --> 00:45:01,575
restrictions within content networks.

836
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:04,935
Um, there's also a huge discussion
happening today within Russia and Ukraine,

837
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:08,205
which I'm not going to get political,
but even sometimes we talk about networks

838
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,125
and accessibility is a huge concern.

839
00:45:10,155 --> 00:45:12,885
Sometimes actually accessing your
customers might be challenging

840
00:45:12,915 --> 00:45:13,965
because of now Netflix work.

841
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:16,395
So we want to ultimately be
able to access your users.

842
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:16,905
Are the world.

843
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:21,815
And so do you, the network might be
actually blocked for a variety of reasons.

844
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:23,675
You wanna make sure that your
CDNs can actually get around

845
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:25,565
these things to connect with
the customers for your audits.

846
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:29,705
So, um, China's is probably the
biggest concern because sometimes

847
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:32,675
getting around the so-called great
firewall of China makes it hard to

848
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:35,165
get this audience of there, that
your audience is actually there.

849
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:38,465
You wanna make sure that you're either
noted from an ad standpoint or the

850
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:39,815
actual cluster for your website.

851
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:42,635
That's there, that's hosted on a
utilized, but WordPress house can

852
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:44,495
actually access that client directly.

853
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:45,035
So.

854
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,560
Uh, long story short, probably his AMP
probably use PWA, probably use a CDN,

855
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,240
make sure it matches up for users.

856
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:55,160
Yogesh Londhe: Right.

857
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,750
