you get when a Canadian and an American

walk into an Australian themed bar?

35
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,490
Rachel Winchester: Hi, I'm not sure.

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,899
Matt Graham: Well, I don't either,
but our next speaker is Amanda Gorman

37
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,399
and she's going to be presenting
chair yoga for remote work.

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,210

00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:39,210
Amanda Gorman: Hello.

43
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,380
Matt Graham: Hello.

44
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,359
Amanda Gorman: How are you?

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,760
Matt Graham: Good, you?.

46
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,269
Amanda Gorman: I'm doing well.

47
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:46,290
Happy to be here.

48
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,359
Matt Graham: Awesome, well take it away.

49
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,260
Amanda Gorman: Awesome.

50
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,130
Sounds good.

51
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,049
Welcome everyone.

52
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,519
I thank you for joining me wherever
you are in the world for a little

53
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,649
bit of time to just slow down.

54
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,519
So that's going to be the
theme for this session today.

55
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,059
Just kind of taking some
time to just be here.

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,850
And see what's going on in our bodies,
explore how we're feeling and truly

57
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,399
just take a pause if you're anything
like me, uh, I'm kind of going all the

58
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,590
time, just with all the projects, the
work, the family, all the things, right?

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,350
So making pausing and slowing down
a priority can be a challenge.

60
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,439
And that's where for me, my
yoga practice comes into play.

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,659
So thank you again for being.

62
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:35,985
First to get set up.

63
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:40,065
Uh, you can be in any arrangement
in any form of a chair.

64
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,225
I, it can be a wheelie chair.

65
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,054
It doesn't need to be a chair like mine.

66
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:48,405
Um, just find a place where
you're going to feel comfortable.

67
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,304
That's the goal.

68
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,674
And I have a blanket underneath my seats.

69
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:55,815
So if you do have something nearby that
you can prop yourself up a little bit

70
00:04:55,815 --> 00:05:01,424
higher, I find that that helps to allow
yourself to grow tall through the spine.

71
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,924
As you do, come into a seat.

72
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:07,659
Sometimes our comfortable chairs
tend to let us round in the

73
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,829
low back, uh, which just puts a
little unnecessary pressure here.

74
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,829
So start to find yourself grounding
in your seats, find your feet

75
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:19,750
on your floor in front of you.

76
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:24,880
Maybe you scooch forward a little bit in
your chair to really feel yourself not

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,100
feeling the temptation of leaning back.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,289
And you're really trying
to activate the muscles.

79
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:33,345
In the abdomen and the whole
trunk of the body to sit up

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,145
as tall as you possibly can.

81
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:41,204
So the first is bringing awareness
to that height in your spine.

82
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:44,775
Thinking about maybe a string
from the very top of your

83
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,905
head, pulling yourself up.

84
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:53,745
Can you find even just a little
bit more space, maybe from the

85
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,275
vertebra in the back of the neck?

86
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,100
To where it meets the base of your neck.

87
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,650
Maybe the shoulders can
relax down into the back.

88
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,159
The hands can find a nice,
comfortable spot to rest.

89
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm kind of following that down the
spine where maybe that tricky spot right

90
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,319
between the shoulder blades might find
a little bit more space and into the.

91
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,130
Low back.

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,140
I'm just feeling the pelvis resting
firmly on your chair, the legs on

93
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,059
the chair and the feet on the floor.

94
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,819
Stay with that height, that
length that you've created.

95
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:58,184
Notice where you might be
holding tension in your jaw,

96
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,245
in the space between your eyes.

97
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:15,664
Maybe take a nice, big exhale out
through the mouth here can make it

98
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,794
really loud and make it audible.

99
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,034
Let the jaw on hinge on the way out.

100
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,265
Let's do that another two times.

101
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,949
Really let the shoulders drop one more.

102
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,780
Allow yourself to just sit in this
space here for a moment to truly

103
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,860
pause, physically stopping our body.

104
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,750
To hopefully allow our mind to catch up
to the pace that we're entering in these

105
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,089
few moments that we'll have together.

106
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:13,890
I can notice the sounds in your
environment, the temperature of your room.

107
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,330
Tell your close feel against your skin

108
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,860
and the breath moving in your body.

109
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,680
Stay with your breath here.

110
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,510
And then just starting to move some
fingers and toes again, noticing the

111
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,250
sounds in the room that you're in.

112
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:22,094
And if your eyes were closed, go
ahead and blink them back open.

113
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,525
You can choose to keep your eyes closed.

114
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:28,604
If you just would like to listen to
my prompts, whatever works for you.

115
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:32,324
We're just going to start
moving through the neck first.

116
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,265
So we're going to drop our chin
to the chest and not change

117
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:38,415
anything else about our posture.

118
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,584
We're going to try to keep that
length and not the chin as close

119
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:44,324
as we can get to the chest.

120
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,135
And we're just going to make little
circles drawing or kind of half circles

121
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:56,564
rather drawing the chin over to one
shoulder so that you're kind of looking

122
00:09:56,564 --> 00:10:04,364
over that shoulder and bring the
chin back to center and draw it over.

123
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:08,415
The other shoulder can be really
small movements, especially if the

124
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,694
neck is feeling particularly tight.

125
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,739
Let's do that another
time when you decide,

126
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,839
and as you come to that second side,
pause there and keep turning to look over

127
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,339
that shoulder as if you could line up
your chin and the tip of your shoulder.

128
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:40,324
Good.

129
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:43,954
And we're going to come back through
the middle, down, back to the

130
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:51,064
chest over to that other side and
just pausing as you bring the chin

131
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,715
right over top of the shoulder.

132
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:56,375
Not trying to hype that
shoulder up higher.

133
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:04,324
I'm trying to keep it level and
bring the chin back down to send you.

134
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,050
At bringing the chin back
up to neutral and just kinda

135
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,000
shake the shoulders out there.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,790
Might've been some tension growing in
there in between the shoulder blades.

137
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,010
Maybe you hear some nice sounds coming
from moving the shoulders this way.

138
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,810
That's all good.

139
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,430
Go the other direction.

140
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,300
Moving those shoulders and bigs.

141
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:37,744
Notice which way feels maybe a little
more comfortable than the other.

142
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:44,045
Good start to let that settle here.

143
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,944
We're going to come back to the neck
here, bringing the chin down to the chest.

144
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,110
And bringing the chin
up towards the ceiling.

145
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,380
And again, trying to keep
your torso, not moving.

146
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,230
We're keeping everything
really stable in our spine.

147
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,290
If you think about drawing the rib
cage in, without talking the tailbone,

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,140
drop the chin back down to the chest.

149
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,364
Let's bring the chin back up towards
the ceiling again, and I'm holding

150
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:22,474
my rib cage here because it kind
of allows me to have a cue to keep

151
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:26,524
everything in and not back bend here.

152
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:31,444
Cause that's when I opened my neck,
our lumbar and our cervical spine

153
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:36,994
are connected and a lot of ways there
are secondary curves that develop.

154
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:44,069
When we start to walk when we're
just babies and they're supportive

155
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,780
systems for us and they are deeply
connected and we have to uncouple

156
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:55,930
that connection to really create
segmentation in our spine to physically

157
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,449
slow down the way our body moves.

158
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,729
Let's do just one more like that.

159
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:11,785
Maybe you go a little bit more deeply in
either direction to see if your range can

160
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:21,895
expand, then come back, chin to chest.

161
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:26,005
Once again, this time we're
going to put it all together.

162
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,084
So starting with the chin.

163
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,259
Bringing your chin over to one shoulder.

164
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,509
Like we did originally looking over
that shoulder and then sort of tipping

165
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,160
the head back in that direction to
bring the ear over the shoulder.

166
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,420
But again, trying not to keep
that shoulder from creeping up,

167
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:52,259
keep it down and slowly, let it
tilt back until it circles all

168
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,410
the way over to the other side.

169
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,800
Where you have your ear kind of
encroaching over that shoulder, as best as

170
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:11,909
you can turning to look over that shoulder
and bringing the chin back down, let's

171
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,129
go one more direction or one more time.

172
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,249
That direction go slow.

173
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:27,595
Notice your sticky parts, the spots
that are just kind of like, Ooh,

174
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:32,815
that doesn't feel normal or familiar.

175
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:39,325
And if there's a painful spot, you
can certainly skip anything that,

176
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,425
but there's a difference
between discomfort and pain.

177
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:48,704
As you come, bring that
chin back to the chest.

178
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:52,454
Go the other direction, drawing
with your chin over the shoulder.

179
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:57,675
First, looking over the shoulder,
turning the head to bring the ear over

180
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:03,405
the shoulder, leaning back with the
head, rolling around to the other side.

181
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,130
Have you lost the integrity
of your spine check.

182
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,600
Check-in stay tall.

183
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,610
We're doing two rounds of this.

184
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,650
So maybe you're on your second round.

185
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,970
Finishing up here.

186
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,880
No rush.

187
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,474
Bring it back to center.

188
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:44,344
And again, I let go of that tension.

189
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,594
You might've been holding
the, keep the torso up.

190
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:48,545
Just kinda let it go.

191
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:52,175
Shake the shoulders out, let the
arms be loose with the torso.

192
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:52,954
Be loose now.

193
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,660
All right.

194
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,079
So just moving the legs around a bit,
we haven't been moving the lower part

195
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,339
of our body a bit yet, so it's kind
of bringing some awareness to the

196
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,530
legs, bring the knees in and out,

197
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,030
and then reground through your feet.

198
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,129
Maybe check in with your seats.

199
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,629
See if you need to readjust.

200
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,420
Find that length through the spine.

201
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,310
Once again, that string pulling you
up as tall as you can be noticing.

202
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,930
If you tend to back then in this position
in draw the front of the rib cage of

203
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:36,040
these bony sections here in the rib
cage, draw them in towards the back of

204
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,530
the body without talking the tailbone
under, keep a nice curve in your low back.

205
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,060
And then we're going to start to
play with what it feels like to

206
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,680
move this section of the body,
which is notoriously challenging.

207
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,849
So we're going to bring our hands
as best we can to our sides.

208
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:59,629
Maybe you can reach up to your
rib cage and really feel that

209
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:04,129
section, or just bring your hands
to your hips or to your waist.

210
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,560
Whatever feels accessible.

211
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,355
We're just going to try to feel
this rib cage reaching over the edge

212
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:14,565
of your chair and back to center.

213
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:22,155
And again, over one edge and back,
let's do this a couple times.

214
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:25,375
It's okay.

215
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:32,685
If we're not quite feeling it right away,
we're just playing, moving the body.

216
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,679
Check-in that you're breathing,
not holding the breath,

217
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,270
focusing on the movement,

218
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:55,239
but being in your body in this moment
and exactly what your body needs to

219
00:17:55,239 --> 00:18:00,159
sustain this activity, which is breathing.

220
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,209
Don't stop breathing.

221
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,290
Come back to center and such to
just kind of bring yourself forward.

222
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,350
Now we can kind of bring our hands to
our legs and just feel a little bit of

223
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,020
a back then the chest coming forward.

224
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,470
Right.

225
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,810
And then the opposite action is rounding
through the upper back, trying to

226
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,040
feel like you can collapse through
the collarbones, the chest, maybe the

227
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,980
head even drops tailbone curls under.

228
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:31,455
And go the opposite action chest
leans forward, maybe chin, chin

229
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:36,745
lifts, tailbone reaches back again.

230
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:40,315
Find your range here.

231
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:53,905
Let's do one more on each director.

232
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,429
And come back to center, we're
going to put it all together.

233
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:06,209
So open the legs up a little bit wider,
maybe come to the edge of your chair.

234
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,120
So you have a little bit more
room behind you and around you.

235
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,840
So we're gonna start to lean forward in,
start to shimmy our way over to one side

236
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,389
round lean over that chair come forward.

237
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,830
So we're stirring the pot.

238
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,510
I imagine the pot is our pelvis
and the spine is kind of that

239
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:38,950
ladle in the pot and moving around,
touching every corner of the pot.

240
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,090
Hopefully you're feeling some
things here, waking some things up.

241
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:57,004
Certainly go the other direction when
you're ready using the hands on the

242
00:19:57,004 --> 00:20:05,925
legs for support and kind of this
resistance tension that you can build

243
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,904
to really just move through the torso.

244
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:11,114
Keep the lower half in mobile.

245
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,675
Really stationary,

246
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,295
start to finish.

247
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:28,085
And come back and slow yourself down and
come back to that original position again.

248
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:28,965
Readjust.

249
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:31,565
All right.

250
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,465
Now here, bring your hands to your hips
and just start to feel a little tilt

251
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,005
tucking under an untucking of the pelvis.

252
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,185
So tucking under means you're
curling your tailbone underneath

253
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,775
you rounding through the local.

254
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,490
Untucking means we're really
sticking our bottom out.

255
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,370
Kind of feeling that back then,
sensation in the low back.

256
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:59,350
See if you can come find that position
back and forth and bonus points.

257
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,220
If you can keep your rib cage from
moving very much, can you keep your

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,720
upper body still as you move your pelvis?

259
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,790
Not so easy.

260
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,100
But that's what I mean when we talk
about segmentation of the spine,

261
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:22,810
trying to isolate movement and
every part, every vertebra can move

262
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,600
individually instead of in sections.

263
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,890
All right.

264
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,650
Come back to a more neutral
position in your pelvis.

265
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,360
Notice what that's like and
reground through your feet here.

266
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,960
So what I'm going to start doing with
my feet is coming up onto my toes.

267
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,770
You might not be able to see my toes
quite, but I'm lifting up to lift my

268
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,940
heels up off the floor, coming up onto
my toes, and then coming back down,

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,520
flexing my toes up towards the ceiling.

270
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,560
And then again, coming up onto the
toes, lift the heels up, bring the

271
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,900
heels down and lift the toes up.

272
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,400
Really flex them.

273
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:00,870
Good.

274
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,889
Couple of times like that.

275
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,360
Notice that the whole foot wants to lift
up off the floor when you're trying to

276
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,170
lift your toes to see if you can lift
only your toes when you're flexing

277
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,730
good, come back.

278
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,179
And we're gonna hold here
with our feet on the floor.

279
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,620
Heels on the floor.

280
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,730
Toes lifted.

281
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,720
Keep lifting the toes.

282
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,469
And now can you start to bring your
toes down one at a time from the pinky

283
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:39,090
side first in, can you do one at a time?

284
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:45,219
Try that a couple times, trying
to find segmentation in your feet.

285
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,409
It's hard to do both at the
same time, but do your best.

286
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,199
And now try from the big toe.

287
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:57,770
See if you can put just your big
toe down, lift the other toes up.

288
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:06,810
And then can the second toe come down
and then the third and so on down

289
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,430
to the pinkies, that's pretty much
impossible for me, but I can pretend,

290
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:16,230
and it works some serious muscles in
the feet to try to make that happen.

291
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,690
Maybe one day when you're at
the kitchen sink practice.

292
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:24,815
Good.

293
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,125
All right, let go of
that tension in the feet.

294
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:30,005
Roll the ankles, roll the
knees around a little bit.

295
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:30,905
Let that go.

296
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:34,385
If you want to take a moment to
take a sip of water or anything

297
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,905
that you might need right now,
I'm just going to check our time.

298
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,445
Perfect.

299
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,125
All right.

300
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,735
So kind of moving our
way back up the body.

301
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:49,465
Now we're going to start to extend one
leg out and flex and point the foot.

302
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,960
Roll the ankle

303
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,300
roll the ankle the other way.

304
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,630
Good.

305
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,260
And then if we would like a little
extra here, we're going to start

306
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,240
to lift the knee up off the floor.

307
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,440
No matter what foot is lifted.

308
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,070
We're just going to try to grab it,
grab the leg, rather, grab the knee.

309
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,550
See if you can hug that knee
in towards your chest while

310
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,800
keeping your spine nice and long.

311
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,010
Like we have been, can you flex the foot?

312
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,510
Spread the toes.

313
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,940
Good.

314
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,620
Hold that.

315
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,470
And I'm going to ask you to press
down through the other foot from.

316
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:40,165
And imagine you're going to let go of
this leg, but it's not going to going

317
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,054
where this leg is going to stay lifted.

318
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,395
Imagine that that's a reality.

319
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:44,995
Okay.

320
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:50,574
So in 3, 2, 1, we're going to let go
see if we're going to hold the leg

321
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:56,995
up, squeeze it in for another three,
two, and one, go ahead and let it go.

322
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:00,745
Let the legs come in and
out here for a moment.

323
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,460
All right, we're going to try
the other sides of readjust.

324
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,440
If you need to extend the other
leg and roll or I'm sorry, flexing

325
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:16,480
point first and roll the foot.

326
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,770
Roll the ankle

327
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,389
rule the other direction.

328
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,070
And then we're going to start to flex
that foot, bring the knee in towards the

329
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,740
chest and hold onto the outside of that.

330
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,130
Like, if that's accessible for
you today, you might also just

331
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,500
pull if that feels better for you.

332
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,730
It's okay.

333
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,840
If we can't grab it and you know where
we're headed, we're going to be pressing

334
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,610
down through that other leg, firmly
lifting through our chest, trying to

335
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,940
stay nice and tall through the spine.

336
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,680
And we're going to imagine we're going
to let go of this leg in three, two,

337
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,160
and actually let go in one, hold it up.

338
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,750
See if you can keep that leg lifted.

339
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,940
See if you can even lift it a little
higher and hold for three, two,

340
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,390
and one, go ahead and let that go.

341
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,080
Shake it out.

342
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,500
Do whatever feels good
to release that tension.

343
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,610
Good ground down through the feet.

344
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,030
Once again.

345
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,750
We're going to start to bring our arms up
towards the back of our head, lifting the

346
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,900
elbows up, interlace the hands in the back
of the head and kind of let the head rest

347
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,550
up against the back of the hands a bit.

348
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,600
Find that length in your spine once more.

349
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,670
And this time we're going to start to
bring one elbow down towards the floor.

350
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:50,975
And really focusing on opening
up the other side, ribcage.

351
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:55,115
So not back bending here, but
instead, really side bending,

352
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,875
opening up through the waist,

353
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,465
keep grounded through both feet.

354
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:09,315
And so to bring it back with control.

355
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,280
And we'll go do the other side.

356
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,580
So dipping that other elbow
down, trying to point the other

357
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,160
elbow up towards the ceiling.

358
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,450
Any amount

359
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:28,700
notice if your back bending instead of
side bending, keep this in the side.

360
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Good.

361
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,750
Such as slowly come back with.

362
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,655
Dip to the other side, the original side.

363
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:47,775
Once again, and this time we're going
to point the top elbow forward as if

364
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:50,115
we're pointing our chest to the floor.

365
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:55,515
And that top elbow now starts
to become the bottom elbow.

366
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:59,205
As we rule over to the other side.

367
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:00,915
Now we're on the opposite side.

368
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:03,945
Good.

369
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,345
So to pull yourself all the way back up.

370
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:08,770
Good.

371
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,150
Now we're going to drop the
opposite side first, where we just

372
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,370
were go back in that direction.

373
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,750
Doesn't really matter which direction
you're going at the end of the day here.

374
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,940
Just moving the body again, whichever
elbow is on top is now going to start

375
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,159
to point forward in front of you.

376
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:30,340
So the chest starts to
level out with the ground.

377
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,020
That top elbow is going to start
to become the bottom elbow.

378
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:46,415
As you got to roll over to the other
side and lift back up, go ahead and

379
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:49,295
release the arms down and take a moment.

380
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,074
Check in how that's feeling.

381
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm finding that height in your spine.

382
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:13,730
Once more noticing the heartbeat,
the warmth in your body,

383
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,210
if it feels good to you
here, close your eyes.

384
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:34,590
Really start to tap back into
the pace of your breath without

385
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,969
needing to change it at all.

386
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,029
And even if thoughts arise and take
you somewhere else, just for these last

387
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,949
few moments, stay with your breath.

388
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,350
Choosing to come back again.

389
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,949
And again,

390
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,570
thoughts don't go away.

391
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,469
We just become a little
bit better at observing.

392
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:19,895
Again, just starting to notice
the sounds in your room,

393
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,825
not as how it feels to be in your body.

394
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:40,815
When you feel ready to start to move some
fingers and toes eventually blinking your

395
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,335
eyes and coming back into your space.

396
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:52,895
Just giving yourself a moment to
be grateful for taking a pause for

397
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:55,534
intentionally taking space in your day.

398
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,560
To be with your body, to be with
your mind and to slow down and

399
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,409
thank you for being at WordFest.

400
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,800
Thank you for being here with me
and I hope to see you again soon.

401
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,330
Thank you.
