00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,329
I'm delighted to be sharing this team
inspired you to join your local or

71
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:23,719
global community and discover the
benefits for you and the wider project.

72
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,819
In this talk I will share with you
the learnings and the insights of

73
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,490
being a part of a tech community
during the last seven years.

74
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,355
Let's get started with
what is a community.

75
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:47,385
It is defined as a group of
people who interact with one

76
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,664
another and share common goals.

77
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:50,505
or vision.

78
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:58,365
It can be anything from a place, from
a physical place where people connect

79
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:04,950
or a virtual space as social media
groups and private community platform.

80
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,000
I think part of an engaging community
can give us a sense of belonging.

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,580
It can help us to share persons,
thoughts, and learnings to which

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,659
others can relate and support the
personal growth of each other.

83
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,940
As humans, we tend to benefit
from being with others.

84
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:34,435
Connecting at a part of the meaningful
community is important for their

85
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,685
wellbeing and general mental health.

86
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:44,185
In the next three slides, I'm going
to share some research data would show

87
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,725
how important community engage is.

88
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:55,914
That's have a deeper look at the first
data done on open source, engaging.

89
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,909
Thank you to nonstop news and non-stop
business support, which led me to the

90
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:11,280
source and let us data from 2018 to
2022 in my talk today, this was such

91
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:16,679
elapsed illustrate the benefit that a
community engagement can bring to you.

92
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:27,189
In 2018, 2019, a survey was done
with 67% oh, those who replied.

93
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,280
Found being a part of an open source
community was an important part of the

94
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,760
support system in business and local area.

95
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:45,240
In 2000, 2021, the pandemic here, the
same survey was conducted when it showed

96
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:52,939
an increase of 89%, the comments shared,
examples of how the different committees.

97
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,250
Had helped people connect
and to take together.

98
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,640
This varied from weekly get together to
drop it, to look at a particular issue.

99
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,010
Let's now take a look at the second survey
which is related to community engagement.

100
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:20,025
In 2000 2018, a survey was conducted
where people said what they

101
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,465
learned through tech communities.

102
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:26,085
They had learned practical skills
that they had put into the work place.

103
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:30,375
The same survey was conducted in 2021.

104
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:36,165
The pandemic here at it showed
a decrease in percentage.

105
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:42,645
Do you find the decline was partly due to
fluctuating internet access to office and

106
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,655
job opportunities during the pandemic.

107
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,910
People also reported difficulties
adjusting to learning environment

108
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,460
on video calls, especially with
dealing with multiple demands on

109
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,660
their time from work at home, online
events can add an extra pressure.

110
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,400
We all know that, but by being
a part of the community, people

111
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,710
found ways to adjust their learning
needs and make networks to help.

112
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,730
Let's take a look at the last
survey, which is conducted for

113
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,980
community engagement and wellbeing.

114
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,810
We've talked about how contributing
to a community can help you move

115
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,139
forward and be connected, especially
during the period of crisis.

116
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,430
This has been shown to in many research
studies during and after the pandemic,

117
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,040
let's look at 2018 to 2022 research.

118
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,790
People said involved in open source
and open source community had a

119
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,010
positive effect on their wellbeing.

120
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,100
They felt part of something bigger.

121
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,170
This was a case of both of these
who described themselves as being

122
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,280
on the edge of the community
engagement and regular contributors.

123
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:11,915
In 2008, 2009, the survey showed 34%
of the people that believed in this.

124
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:19,415
In 2000, 2021, 7, 3 73% of
the people believed in this.

125
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:26,735
And 12% of the people reported no effect
or highlighted stress effects from the

126
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:31,185
way of communication had changed in 2021.

127
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,180
This was in line with the wider research
done by non-stop business support and

128
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,710
from other studies global lead showing
that active community engagement can aid

129
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,760
well-being thank you to [inaudible] for
allowing me to include all the research

130
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,920
information for this presentation.

131
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,720
At the end of this presentation,
I will share a link where you

132
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,760
can go and vote anonymous.

133
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,600
Share your thoughts on
benefits at the community.

134
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,060
It will help researchers and
aware, rising being done by groups,

135
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,460
including unplug tech podcast.

136
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,360
It will be shared to assist the Big Orange
Heart the charity behind this wonderful

137
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,720
WordFest event it collaboration is like.

138
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,920
This is another example of how people
come together in a community for

139
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,440
greater participation, diversity, and.

140
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:34,975
Now let's look at how, how you find
a community, understand the different

141
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:39,625
communities around you, choose the
one which help you nurture, and

142
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,875
you feel really where you belong.

143
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:47,395
Community plays an important
role in all aspects of our life.

144
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:55,685
We have communities in our friends, our
family, our neighbors in our employment.

145
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,060
And so many other places, wherever
you go, you will find a community.

146
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,690
Being a part of the community can
make ourselves feel as though we are

147
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,030
a part of something greater, even more
reasons to research and find communities

148
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,760
where you will feel at home and grow.

149
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,030
People always ask me this question.

150
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,270
Why, why am I an advocate of a community?

151
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,875
I believe, I believe a community can
help each one of us in many aspects of

152
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:37,385
our life, a community like WordPress
and give us an opportunity to connect

153
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:42,185
with people, to just search our goals
and be a part of a confidence building.

154
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,285
Before joining the WordPress
community, I was asked a few questions.

155
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,895
Why are you joining the local community?

156
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,714
What are the benefits of
the WordPress community?

157
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,474
Is it community a waste
of time and energy?

158
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,915
What help can they provide?

159
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,704
It seems to be a few, a woman.

160
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:13,175
How will you survive?

161
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,864
These questions did not stop me
from finding a local community.

162
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:25,215
I wanted to surround myself with value
driven people who knew the language

163
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:30,314
of tech and coding and wants to be a
part of helping me make things bigger.

164
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:35,095
This led me to WordPress Mumbai community.

165
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,834
This is where I attended and wanting
to add my first WordCamp Mumbai.

166
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:45,464
Once part of the local community.

167
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,810
I got to know there was a WordPress
community that stretched around the

168
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,420
world events like this means we can
share our voices across the globe.

169
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:07,660
Let's look at some of the benefits of
joining an source community, first friends

170
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,240
and network, making friends and network
who live locally and across the globe.

171
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,030
You never know when friends can
turn into business or life partners.

172
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,040
This is a good way to get to know cultures
and different countries around the world.

173
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,570
Next knowledge learning and mentorship.

174
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,340
Join the community to learn from
and with others and share knowledge.

175
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,770
You will meet different types of
people with different views, experience

176
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,500
and beliefs, learning from them.

177
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,370
Reach insight that we may not
have learned in on our own.

178
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,430
I can certainly vouch for this

179
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:58,150
next collaborating and work opportunities,
collaborating, collaborating

180
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,390
with people from the community to
work on different and interesting

181
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,860
projects, like building websites for
nonprofits and support good causes.

182
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,490
Everyone loves to it.

183
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:08,590
Right.

184
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,214
WordCamps gives us, gives us the
opportunity to, with her friends

185
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:17,175
in the community and explore
different parts of the country.

186
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:25,204
Inspiration in the community
you will find many people who

187
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,064
inspire and motivate others.

188
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,745
Those are the people who you need
to follow, and then don't try

189
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:33,694
to be an inspiration for others.

190
00:15:34,714 --> 00:15:35,194
It has been.

191
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,330
It is because of the people
who have inspired me.

192
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,370
And I have had the privilege
of being mentored by that.

193
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,320
I'm here with you today, able to deliver
a talk on an international platform

194
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,200
and share my experience with everyone

195
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,890
next support being a
part of the community.

196
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,970
And it was asked to give
support to other members.

197
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,535
Supporting others and help them
feel good about themselves and be

198
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:11,145
more confident with so much stress
in busy in today's busy world.

199
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:11,835
We live in.

200
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,515
There's never been the right
time to help those struggling

201
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,775
with the physical and what

202
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:22,835
the physical and mental wellbeing.

203
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:29,645
Next sharing, chatting
activities, ideas, feelings.

204
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:34,800
Reinforces not only a sense
of self, but also adds what

205
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
and value to that community.

206
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,340
Indeed.

207
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,240
The more the merrier lies in this case,

208
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,780
the last don't just take, but give to
any community works better, better when

209
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,280
relationship with it travels in both
direction being apart of the committee.

210
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:02,475
Does not always mean that you should,
you should expect automatically.

211
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,135
You should expect people continuously
and automatically helping you.

212
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:13,244
You need to make an effort to encourage
interact and know people in the community

213
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,554
and support them when they need it.

214
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:24,074
Remember being a part of the
community is a two way street.

215
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,130
There may be so many other benefits
and fossilized ones, especially to you

216
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,389
Sharing my top ten list, which will
hopefully inspire you to step outside

217
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,409
your comfort zone and join the community
that that will help you feel braver to.

218
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,380
WordCamps, and WordPress events.

219
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,165
I attended ,volunteered,
sponsored, spoken at different

220
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:58,844

And in 2019, I was lead
organizer for WordCamp Mumbai.

222
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:13,005
Be great to be interviewed by
international podcasts, including

00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,415

inspire others, to overcome barriers that

225
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,745
they may face in their lives and work

226
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:32,304
finding opportunities to contribute
to WordPress and becoming a team rep

227
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:37,135
for the global WordPress marketing
team, all these oppurtunities

228
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,784
means I can encouraged others.

231
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:54,355
This is how you can be a bot or the
future development of the software.

I have partnered with community
friends, opened up businesses and

245
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,810
worked together on good projects.

246
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,420
But the, for the past two years, I
have been a part of the organizing

247
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,730

249
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,389

A lot of people ask me where do you find
these active and engaging communities?

255
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,930
Here are a few names.

256
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,430

may consider as part of your journey,

This can be in your local town or area.

259
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,090
If you don't have one, start
one, find people who love the

260
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,340
software and build a committee.

261

This is the largest community of
folks working remotely in India and

264
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:44,520
has grown four times in the last
two years because of the pandemic.

WordPress product community on LinkedIn.

If you love Facebook, there's a group
named advanced WordPress on Facebook.

268
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:12,445
There's an other group name, web
creators community on Facebook.

269
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:18,274
There's an other group theme,
WP Builds, but not the least.

Everything is opened

293
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,230
Yogesh Londhe: Oh, good,
good, good, good, good.

294
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:12,254
And, uh, thank you very much
for a fantastic session.

295
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:19,574
And, uh, everybody who knows me
knows that Meher is a community

296
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:22,185
person, a fantastic community leader.

297
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:29,924
So we have a few questions for you meher
and, uh, I'm just glad to chat with you.

298
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:40,574
So start with, could you share an
anecdote, uh, how, what community has

299
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:43,574
benefited you are someone that, you know,

300
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:53,834
so first question is, could you share
an anecdote how, what birth community

301
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:56,534
has benefited you are someone who is.

302
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:01,320
Meher Bala: I think one of
the main benefits on the

303
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:07,040
Yogesh Londhe: Can we have
the questions on the screen.

304
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,129
Did you hear that question?

305
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:09,629
Meher Bala: Yes.

306
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:10,259
I heard it.

307
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:11,969
Yeah.

308
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:19,229
One of the main benefits I think
anyone gets is friendship because

309
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:22,350
that's where the bond is created.

310
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,059
That's where the communication goes.

311
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:31,084
If it's for me, it's the different
friendships around the world, but I

312
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:38,324
own the local community because that
is where it makes a person strong.

313
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:46,514
For example, if I give my example
becoming a part of the local Mumbai

314
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:49,814
community, I met so many different people.

315
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:52,695
It made me go around different words.

316
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,339
It made me travel.

317
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:00,769
It made me meet people like Yogesh
and a lot of other people Rahul

318
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:08,299
and a lot of other people around
India, which by not joining the

319
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,249
community, I may not not have met you.

320
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:16,399
Oh, by joining the international
community, I met amazing

321
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:17,269
people around the world.

322
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:23,999
I'm sure if I travel anywhere, I am
going to have one person, at least in

323
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,079
the WordPress community who will be
a part of that city or that country.

324
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:37,409
And I'll get to explore the local place,
not like a tourist, but like being a part

325
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:43,289
of the city because a lot of times like
tourist, you miss a lot of great cities.

326
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,360
So for me, community is.

327
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,449
First friendship and then everything.

328
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:52,379
Lax Mariappan: Yeah, that is great.

329
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:57,959
Like communities help you grow your,
uh, you know, grow your network.

330
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,449
And that network opens
the door to many options.

331
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:05,625
And then it can be your new job or
like you may meet your new client and

332
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:10,185
in your talk, you mentioned you may
meet you, you know, um, friends, even

333
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:12,105
business partner, or even like partners.

334
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:12,705
It was great.

335
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:13,754
Meher Bala: Yeah.

336
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:20,925
Actually, because I have seen
recently you do meet your life

337
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,355
partners as well in the community.

338
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:24,405
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

339
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:25,395
Like minded people.

340
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:25,725
Yeah.

341
00:27:25,784 --> 00:27:27,975
That, that ignites the spark.

342
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,120
It's nice.

343
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:36,000
Nice to, uh, and so, so, um, how
about the five for the future?

344
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,840
Like, you know, it's a community
driven event, so can you share us

345
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,300
like, uh, you know, maybe some of us
who are watching this may not know

346
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,540
about five for the feature and a lot
of people assume that it's for, only

347
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,590
for developers are like, you know,
contributing to the code or, uh, like,

348
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,659
uh, and maybe other ways to contribute.

349
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:54,929
Right.

350
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,490
So please tell us about.

351
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,330
It can be a part of the
community and contribute in

352
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,649
the five for the feature works.

353
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:06,870
Meher Bala: So being a part of the
WordPress community doesn't mean you

354
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,509
need to be a developer or you need to
know code, or you need to know, you

355
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:17,219
know what all, you know, you just need
to know PHP or, uh, any coding, like.

356
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:20,145
If you are a market out
there, a space for you.

357
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:22,485
If you are a translator,
there is space for you.

358
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:27,794
If you're a designer that has space
for you, if you are a community

359
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:29,264
manager, there is space for you.

360
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:36,585
There is space for everyone in this
community to five for futures, not only

361
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:43,155
for sponsored contributors, but for sales,
sales, sponsored contributors as well.

362
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:44,315
Give.

363
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,850
Some part of your time to the
software, which is helping you on

364
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,610
your bread and butter for some people.

365
00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:01,050
Because when you spend time with the
software, that's because indirectly

366
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,629
the software, if you help the software
grow, you're growing yourself as well.

367
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:14,434
So that's why five for future helps
and anyone is allowed to join.

368
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,945
Everyone is allowed to join.

369
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:21,674
Everyone is encouraged to contribute
to different aspects of the community.

370
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:25,844
If you're hesitant joining the global
community, start with your local

371
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:30,794
community, start with, you know, if you
don't have a local community building.

372
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:35,235
There is ways and means
to get people together.

373
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:38,264
Like nowadays everyone
uses with WordPress.

374
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:44,774
A lot of non developers use WordPress
has set up this shop, set up the, uh,

375
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:52,095
websites and all, get them together,
start a local community and encourage

376
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,185
people translate in your own language.

377
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,514
That's the best way to get started.

378
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:03,509
Lax Mariappan: Great.

379
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,469
A lot of people assume like
they have to be a coder.

380
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,439
Meher Bala: Yes.

381
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:16,080
Even when I joined the local community,
I felt only coders are required.

382
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:23,279
And once I joined the community,
that thought went away because

383
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,749
I joined the marketing team.

384
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,280
I have a strong background of coding,
but being a freelancer marketing also

385
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:39,930
is my, is there in me, so I didn't join
the code, but I joined the marketing.

386
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,950
So, so,

387
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,580
Lax Mariappan: uh, can you hear me now?

388
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,710
Meher Bala: Yes, I can still hear you.

389
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:47,820
Lax Mariappan: Okay.

390
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,210
Great.

391
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,530
So I have a question.

392
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,540
This is, uh, maybe a difficult one, but
not little controversial, but still,

393
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,970
you know, cause I never felt this one.

394
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,790
So you are also from
India, like from Asia.

395
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,650
So how diverse and inclusive the WordPress
communities are because I I've seen

396
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,970
you are part of communities in your
experiences like 15 plus years with

397
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,129
WordPress and you are part of communities.

398
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,169
Not just a participant.

399
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,659
You are a volunteer, you
are, are a lead organizer.

400
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:19,439
So what do you think like, is that
any discrimination or the people

401
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:24,030
are not inclusive in terms of
maybe race, community identity or

402
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,590
whatever language, or I think that

403
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,610
Meher Bala: I have not seen the
inclusive, exclusive as of now.

404
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,850
Yes, though participation
of women is a bit less.

405
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,570
You cannot stay back because of that.

406
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,959
Because when I joined the Mumbai
community, there were hardly any

407
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:50,820
women, but if you were not going
to be the first woman to step up,

408
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,149
someone needs a familiar face.

409
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:56,639
Someone needs familiarity in the crowd.

410
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:04,620
And that's where I think one
needs to take the initiative.

411
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:07,634
WordPress is welcoming to everyone.

412
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:14,114
It doesn't discriminate based on
color or gender or any other thing.

413
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:16,544
It's an open, welcoming community.

414
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:22,554
I have been welcomed by
people who have never met.

415
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:28,674
I have interacted with people who
have very down-to-earth people.

416
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:34,679
It's not that, you know, just because
there are no women or just because,

417
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:38,399
you know, there are very few moments
where you should not participate.

418
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:39,600
No.

419
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:44,639
If there are few women start creating
a group start encouraging woman.

420
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:51,990
That's how women in WordPress woman
in WP got developed, got created.

421
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,679
Lax Mariappan: Uh, that's
good, like, uh, that will help

422
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,149
inspire other women to join.

423
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:03,979
Like you pointed out be the first, like
in WordPress, our default comments, right.

424
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,529
Are like, are WordPress.

425
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,120
We will say be the first one to review
something, like be the first one to join.

426
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,669
So that will help.

427
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:16,639
And it will bring, like, for
example, if Meher joints, maybe

428
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:17,870
her friends might be interested in.

429
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:24,315
So it might be like they might be using
WordPress, maybe shy or hesitant to join.

430
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:28,455
Or then if someone joins there,
they have a familiar face and it

431
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:30,155
brings more women to the community.

432
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:37,485
And it's like also I personally like,
um, uh, bringing tech to women, uh, they

433
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:41,895
can be users and, uh, they can be like,
um, you know, giving the feedback, like

434
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:44,594
any sorts of contribution is welcome.

435
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:48,375
And, uh, especially when you
teach a woman, it's like, you're

436
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,544
teaching your whole family that.

437
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:52,064
So saying in our language,
it's like, you know, cause see

438
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:53,465
some others, she's a sister.

439
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:57,915
Like she is going to teach and spread
the word and that's how things work.

440
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,899
Uh, so women who are watching this

441
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:12,889
Meher Bala: hello

442
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,880
from 2016, till now every WordCamp
I used to go, we used to take out a

443
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,649
group photograph  of all the women.

444
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:31,120
I think if you go compare each
photograph, you'll see the increase in

445
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,970
the number of women attending WordCamps.

446
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,170
And to me, it is like
you creating a network.

447
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,120
You're creating comfort zone.

448
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,159
You're creating familiar faces.

449
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,399
So yes, women need to be encouraged.

450
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,690
Women need to be.

451
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,925
So I would encourage all the
women out there participate.

452
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,934
If you are hesitant, talk to
someone, there are a lot of known

453
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:02,835
faces out in the community who
will be happy to talk to you.

454
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:06,585
If you want to talk to me, you can reach
out to me on Twitter or my website.

455
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:07,125
I'll be happy to.

456
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:09,975
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

457
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:13,725
And here I would like to highlight
or something that we do for every

458
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,675
WordCamp or meet up in everything.

459
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:19,365
Cause we have community rules just like
when you join a Facebook group, they

460
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:20,925
have rules rights or something like that.

461
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:26,115
So every person who's joining or
participating in the WordPress or any

462
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:30,944
WordPress event, we have, um, almost
local or international communities.

463
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:35,685
They have, uh, uh, like any
harassment, violence related or

464
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:36,675
like anything, something that.

465
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:40,005
Uh, inappropriate behavior or whatever.

466
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,385
Like you can report that as well.

467
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:46,005
So it's like, not because of some,
uh, I don't know how to call them.

468
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:51,075
Like, it don't have to be, uh, or
read or like you don't have to step

469
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:53,325
away just because of someone bad.

470
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,990
So there are a lot of
good people out there.

471
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,460
So you might get, find your new employer,
new job in, like, there are many good

472
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,649
opportunities that came out of WordPress.

473
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:07,470
And for me, it's like, I got this, um,
clients and also I met a lot of new

474
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,529
people, friends, and I got me new job.

475
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:14,670
Also, everything is related because
I know somebody in the community

476
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,680
and I get to know more about them.

477
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,109
I meet them, learn them, learn from them.

478
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,279
So things like.

479
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:22,274
Meher Bala: Yeah.

480
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:25,154
Eventually when you're a part of
the community, when you interact

481
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:28,515
with community, I think slowly
steady, everything falls into place.

482
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:34,635
But as I said in my talk community, this
two way street, if you only expect the

483
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:40,814
community to give you every information
and you don't reply, or you don't engage

484
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,755
with people, how would people come to
know that you are a part of the committee?

485
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,995
You also need to make that effort.

486
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:49,245
I understand people are shy.

487
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,115
Even I was shy.

488
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:51,404
I'm not going to say no.

489
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:58,274
The first two meetups, I did not come
in together to anyone, but it was great.

490
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:05,894
It was, I made an effort to break the
barrier and start talking to people.

491
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:07,394
I made that effort.

492
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:08,924
So it is a two way.

493
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:14,135
Yogesh Londhe: So nice
chatting with you, Meher.

494
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:22,835
Um, any, any advice you have for,
uh, the WordPress community is a

495
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,635
budding WordPress community is new
WordPress communities to thrive?

496
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:33,035
Meher Bala: If you're just
started and you're not getting the

497
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:38,705
people, you're not finding people,
don't lose heart, give it time.

498
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:47,175
Give it energy because initial stage
of starting is difficult for any group

499
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:53,774
to go ahead, but don't close heart,
better people who will support you

500
00:37:54,645 --> 00:38:00,600
just keep on building and you will
grow to a very big community even, I

501
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,800
think Yogesh can agree with me with
when he started WordCamp Bangalore

502
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,740
community from a small community.

503
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,120
It became large.

504
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,740
Like when I started WordCamp
Mumbai, I didn't start the

505
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,940
WordCamp Mumbai community.

506
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,040
But when I joined, I heard that the
WordCamp Mumbai community was started

507
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,230
by, two people sharing one big dosa
and today's a very huge community.

508
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,589
So don't lose hope if
you're just getting started.

509
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:43,180
Yogesh Londhe: I had talking to two south
Indians and we know the magic dosa can do.

510
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,089
Dosa can make anything possible.

511
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,100
Meher Bala: Yeah,
[inaudible] three people.

512
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:55,935
Yogesh Londhe: Uh, the influence of
south India is not the power, the

513
00:38:55,935 --> 00:39:01,815
soft power, the culture, the style.

514
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:05,115
Lax?.

515
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:07,125
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

516
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:13,245
So was actually, uh, wondering about,
uh, for example, if I have a local

517
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:17,525
community, like, I like to say like
WordCamp Chennai or maybe WordPress

518
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:19,095
Chennai, something like that.

519
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:19,875
I have a.

520
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:25,035
Uh, some part of remote village or
somewhere in India or something.

521
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:29,865
And how can I, uh, connect with what
comes central or like WordPress central

522
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:33,045
thing, like a local community, how
they can interact with international

523
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:38,145
community and how, how things go, uh,
like, um, it's going to be difficult or

524
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:40,155
is it kind of welcoming or how it works

525
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:45,225
Meher Bala: No, it is welcoming, uh, to
join the international community, come

526
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,565
on slack, coming to community channel.

527
00:39:48,495 --> 00:39:50,715
Put your, uh, credit.

528
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,475
There are a lot of
people who will help you.

529
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:58,335
There are a lot of people in India who are
there, the international slack as well.

530
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,045
You know, you will get it.

531
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:05,265
You'll get every help needed,
whether it be local or international,

532
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:06,705
you'll get every help needed.

533
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:10,605
So just reach out to people on slack.

534
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:16,545
Lax Mariappan: So great.

535
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:18,405
So it was actually nice talking to you.

536
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:22,005
And when you see Meher's profile
on WordPress, it's like she

537
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,495
got almost all the badges.

538
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:24,255
That's no

539
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:26,655
Meher Bala: No, I have
not got all the badges.

540
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:28,725
Lax Mariappan: Oh, what is missing?

541
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,384
Uh, I'm just curious.

542
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:32,255
Meher Bala: Lots.

543
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,275
I think design is missing,

544
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:39,135
Lax Mariappan: but you are a
designer, you are a content person.

545
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:44,475
Meher Bala: Yeah, that team I still
have to collaborate with, but there are

546
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,865
other teams that I have contributed to,

547
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:54,405
but it's not the badges only.

548
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:58,455
It's just contributing and doing
and seeing the software grow.

549
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:00,165
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.

550
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,585
But it's like a badge, just like a,
we can take it like a recognition

551
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:04,785
or like something that's like.

552
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,630
Uh, you know, milestone or something
that motivates others like to do.

553
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,660
That's why we, we to gamification.

554
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,230
So that's why we gamify it.

555
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,060
Meher Bala: Partly yes, I agree.

556
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,120
Yes.

557
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:21,930
Lax Mariappan: Yeah.
