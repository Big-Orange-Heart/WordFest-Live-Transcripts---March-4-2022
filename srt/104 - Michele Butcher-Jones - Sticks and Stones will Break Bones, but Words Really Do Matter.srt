Hi Misty.

36
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,265
How was your break?

37
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:06,015
Misty Combs: Um, great, thank you Cathy.,
our next speaker is Michele Butcher-Jones

38
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:09,695
presenting sticks and stones will break
bones, but words really do matter.

39
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:11,765
We had the pleasure of
meeting her a few minutes ago.

40
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,934
Michele is a leading word, press
technical specialist at Thrive

41
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:20,524

runs her own WordPress shop at 13 Core.

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,415
She has also the head geek out.

43
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:27,005
Over at Can't Speak Geek
when not working her jobs.

44
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:30,064
Michele is an organizer at WordCamp St.

45
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:33,695

You can usually find her snapping
pictures at the gym, hanging with

47
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,755
her family or reading a book.

48
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,454
She's always down for an
adventure, especially if it

49
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,804
involves great food or drinks.

50
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:44,644
Welcome Michele.

51
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,505
Michele Butcher-Jones: Hello everyone.

52
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:49,934
I hope you can all hear me.

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,870
And my slides are still
backstage at seams.

54
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:58,130
There we go.

55
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,390
Uh, hope everyone's having a great day,
night, evening, afternoon, whatever

56
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,220
it is in your neck of the woods.

57
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,430
But watching those videos, Devin
from Bluehost, we need to talk

58
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,719
about me seeing a nice big bowl
of ramen right before I talk.

59
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,130
Well, we'll get into this.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,840
Um, let me get over there and starting
off a little bit about myself, um, as

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,500
mentioned, I'm the lead support specialist
at thrive digital marketing agency?

62
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,340
Um, I have my own, um, in-house
agency that I do, um, hosting and,

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,969
um, support management with, um,
blogger over at Can't Speak Geek

64
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:52,034
and enthusiast of volunteering and
organizing WorkCamps and taking pictures.

65
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:58,395
Now we're getting into why is
effective communication important?

66
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:04,909
Um, It's not only just speaking,
but writing and body language

67
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,150
all goes into your communication.

68
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,060
And when the communication is effective,
it sets expectations from the start.

69
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,349
So there won't be as many questions
on what you mean by what you

70
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,390
say and what did they hear?

71
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,530
And it makes feed, people feel like
they're being actually listened to and

72
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,700
that their point is getting across.

73
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,210
And in a business, it can reduce,
turn in distress, this trust and

74
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,460
conflict, because you are setting
the bar exactly where it should be.

75
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:41,810
And you're putting everyone
onto a level playing field.

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,820
There's no questions of, will
this actually get accomplished?

77
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,849
Am I being scanned or anything like that?

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,890
And you will build trust
within one of them.

79
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,100
Because you as a sender, you need
to make sure you put across what you

80
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,490
mean in the message of what you say
so that the receiver takes in exactly

81
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,620
what, uh, what you want them to hear.

82
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,590
And by nature, we're really selfish.

83
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,220
Communicate.

84
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:20,495
Um, we don't really mean to be,
uh, we tend to talk a lot about in

85
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:26,705
the perspection of I's and me's,
and unfortunately that's a bit of a

86
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:32,675
narcissistic default because it makes
us spend more times of the I's and

87
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:39,125
the me's instead of stepping back and
having the you's and we's and our brain

88
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,375
is actually more responsible for that.

89
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:42,755
And it starts out.

90
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,419
At birth because in the first few years of
life, you're very much of a everything's

91
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,979
black and white, hot and cold do not
touch this because it can hurt you.

92
00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:01,369
And it's a lot of autopilot and
it grows from there in this trend,

93
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,020
kind of goes through childhood.

94
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,340
It's a very, um, fight or flight
type of mechanism, but then

95
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,869
once you hit adulthood, it's
just kind of ingrained in us.

96
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,780
To be that selfish listener.

97
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:21,049
And we're not really aware of it until
we actually step back and think, and look

98
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:24,650
at the words we use in a conversation.

99
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,780
Um, like, uh, one of the biggest ones
I've seen, especially when we're more

100
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,700
blossoming into inclusiveness of being.

101
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:39,065
Um, respectful of pronouns
is the one really big one.

102
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:46,475
Like for example, I know of someone
who, um, is non-binary and goes by

103
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:52,835
they, them and someone wished them a
happy birthday and talked about what

104
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:55,235
a wonderful woman they're becoming.

105
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:57,215
And.

106
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,020
In a way that was a very selfish
response out of the person,

107
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,540
because it was not honoring them
of what they want to be called.

108
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,540
And so with effective communication,
it makes you more mindful of

109
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,780
the words you say and how they
can impact the other person.

110
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,680
And then with that, you are now armed
with the things that you can, um, sorry.

111
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,270
My brother went over there for a
second, um, to access the two most

112
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,430
important concepts in the communication.

113
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:41,210
There's it actually really
just boils down to two things.

114
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:50,180
And the first one is self-awareness and
in any given situation, um, Have those

115
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,609
quick judge of what to say and what to do.

116
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,940
Sorry, um, with that, it's good
to get to the point where you can

117
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,760
detach yourself from the emotions.

118
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,200
And sometimes we respond really
quickly and really harshly without

119
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,210
realizing what we're saying.

120
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,130
And if we take that step back and give
an honest assessment, even if it's a

121
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,345
quick one, Of what we're going to say.

122
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,835
It can actually lead to better outcomes.

123
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:30,385
Now it doesn't really mean make
anything you less than human for, if

124
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:36,805
you do, sometimes the words are pop
off on a response, um, when you're

125
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:42,325
being less than perfect, um, which
is a huge fear for many people.

126
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,194
But the best thing to do is when
there's something does take in

127
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,065
a way, a mental dislike, pause.

128
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:54,444
Okay then respond and no one
can hear inside your brain

129
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,035
for doing those self checks.

130
00:09:56,454 --> 00:10:02,305
And when you do take those pauses,
sometimes before you speak, it

131
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:07,765
shows that other person that you
are taking the time to give a good

132
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:12,565
answer and practicing the pause.

133
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:17,545
Not only helps in effective communication,
but can also help with mental.

134
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,359
'cause how many times have you said
something in that split second decision

135
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:30,139
and then instantly regretted it, um,
stayed up like sometimes two, three

136
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:34,550
years later, something gets in your
head of why did I say that so quickly?

137
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:37,520
I should've stopped, um, stop
for a second and thought about.

138
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,984
And then also sympathy versus empathy.

139
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:51,655
Sympathy is a feelings of pity and
sorrow for someone else's fortune, where

140
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,575
you're just like, oh, I'm so sorry.

141
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:56,555
Oh, I thoughts and prayers,
that kind of stuff.

142
00:10:56,855 --> 00:11:02,825
But empathy is the ability to understand
and share the feelings of one another.

143
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:07,444
And it's really empathy that
makes someone a good and effective

144
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:11,765
communicator because you're recognizing
those other people's feelings.

145
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:16,175
You're recognizing that their
thoughts are real to them or

146
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,615
their feelings are real with them.

147
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,444
And that you are with them.

148
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:25,625
And when you're only having sympathy,
there's that whole disconnect because

149
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,725
with sympathy that's you and I'm me.

150
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:34,835
And that's when you see a lot of the
qualifying words like the at least,

151
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:42,064
or if I, or, but, but as one of the
biggest qualifiers there is, cause

152
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,735
it'd be like, I'm sorry, you're sick.

153
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,074
But when I was this.

154
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:52,594
And it really takes away those feelings
of validation from the other person.

155
00:11:55,225 --> 00:12:00,634
Then also always err, on the side of
clarity, because it's not really about

156
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:08,525
the message you send to people, but,
um, the message that they receive, um,

157
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:13,925
and the more effective, the more on
purpose you can be with your words.

158
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,380
The more clarity they have.

159
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,930
And then on the flip side of
that is at the end, you have them

160
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,400
kind of repeat it back to you.

161
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:30,459
Like, you know, say, this is what I
understand, or if I get this right,

162
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,430
you mean dada, and kind of like at the
end of a client meeting that you might

163
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,689
have with someone and you send out that
email of going over, everything that was

164
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:44,449
said, Not just with me after meetings.

165
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,860
Is that good after really any
conversation that you think your

166
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,900
message might not be getting across?

167
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,749
It's good to revert back
and go over everything.

168
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:58,400
And then.

169
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:05,165
Um, we'll get into kind of just
building a voice guide for people.

170
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:10,445
Um, if you have one kind of for
yourself, or if you are a person

171
00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:18,035
who owns a company on how to set up,
um, a voice guide for getting your

172
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:22,295
point across what words to use in
conversations, what works not to use.

173
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,699
And here are some general
communicating tips.

174
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:36,229
These can go over email, um, chat,
talking, uh, public situations rather

175
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,570
pretty much any style of communication.

176
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,959
Okay.

177
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,699
That's not in there and
should not be there.

178
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,199
Let me just skip over that one.

179
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,670
Sorry about that.

180
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,070
I look these over now.

181
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,249
One.

182
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:49,959
I never saw.

183
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:55,625
The first one soon will never
come in a professional setting.

184
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:00,995
You should never use the word soon
because soon does not really have any

185
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:07,475
definitive, um, um, wording to it.

186
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:13,085
Cause if I say, oh, I will get to
that soon and get back to you in my

187
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,265
head that soon could be, I'll have
that done by the end of the week.

188
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:20,525
Now the person I say this
to takes the word soon.

189
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,805
It means, oh, they'll have
that done this afternoon.

190
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:27,844
So when this evening comes around or
the next morning comes around, I'm

191
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:32,195
getting an email saying, Hey, I'm
looking for an update on that task or

192
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:35,285
that question, because you said that
you'd have an answer back to me soon.

193
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:39,785
And in my head, I was like, oh,
I wasn't planning on getting

194
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,945
to that till later today.

195
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,020
So if you give them a definitive
timeframe, and now that doesn't mean

196
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,790
it has to be due by that timeframe,
it could be you just plan on giving

197
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,640
them an update and an update could
be we're still working on it.

198
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,290
But if you give a definitive time,
like for that one example, I thought it

199
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,610
would be done by the end of the week.

200
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,920
I could have went back to the person
and said, thanks for sending that over.

201
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,439
I will have that information back
to you by the end of the week.

202
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,360
So they know they don't
even have to contact.

203
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:18,110
Until the end of the week to get that
information from me because they know

204
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,969
it's not going to be there till that time.

205
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,590
And that gives you more time to
do what you need to do instead

206
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,189
of answering questions, because
there was not a qualified time.

207
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:36,860
And when communicating in email,
always make sure your subject

208
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,320
lines of your emails are clearing.

209
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:46,564
This is mostly due to a lot of the
spamming that goes on that nowadays,

210
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:54,275
where you get one that might say, you
know, open this for your website or.

211
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:58,895
It reads like, oh, I don't even
need to look on this when it's

212
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:00,364
an actually important email.

213
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:05,555
And then if you are working with a lot of
clients, if this is your business email,

214
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:10,025
it makes it a lot easier for if you put
that client name or that client business.

215
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:14,885
Like, we'll say if one of my clients
is big orange heart, and we're talking

216
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:19,805
about building a new form, I would put
like big orange tart dash new form.

217
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:21,505
So when I'm looking at my.

218
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:27,425
I can pick out the one that's four, and
that also helps with your clients because

219
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:32,135
they know which one is attached to which,
but if I just email it over and say, go

220
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:38,584
and charge nothing to it, which emails
us for, or if I say new form, I don't

221
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,475
really know which client that's for.

222
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,430
And email greetings matter when it
comes to communicating in text and

223
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,360
emails, it's always good to address
the person preferably by their names.

224
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:05,675
And, or their like rank or title who,
because like, if they're a doctor, um,

225
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:11,284
if they are, um, someone in clergy, if
they are someone like in the military

226
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:16,235
with a higher ranking, they've earned
that rank and or title and should have,

227
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,185
um, should be referred to as that.

228
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,514
Um, but also by name.

229
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:27,110
If you just kind of go into the meat of
it, of your email without greeting them,

230
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,810
it's a very kind of cold reading email.

231
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,100
And then also when using their
name, please make sure you

232
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,790
are spelling them incorrectly,
especially in a professional setting.

233
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
With my name.

234
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,340
It is only a one L in Michele Frechette.

235
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,600
And I have talked about this on link
of how often my name gets misspelled.

236
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,920
There's always two L's in it.

237
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,520
Sometimes I get Michael instead
of Michele and it's all over that.

238
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:57,635
And most of the time, I don't
even really bothered by it

239
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,315
because it happens all the time.

240
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:05,735
But when it comes to something
professional or something, financial,

241
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:10,025
something kind of more serious,
like it boss emailing me, um,

242
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,855
something from like the government.

243
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:14,375
I kind of expect my name to be spelled.

244
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:14,945
Right.

245
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:21,485
Um, And it, when you're using that kind
of effective communication and having

246
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:28,655
names spelled correctly, people will tend
to be more open and more worth because

247
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,235
you are acknowledging them properly.

248
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:35,975
Now, if you have no idea what their
email is, like, say they emailing in

249
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:40,730
from like, Marketing@bigorangeheart.org.

250
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,890
And you're no idea who it is.

251
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,730
You're talking to.

252
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,640
It's always good to just be
like, hi, there are howdy.

253
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:53,150
Um, or something like that to still
be greeting them without using a name

254
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,510
next, when it comes to effective
communication, especially in

255
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,190
this day and age, gender neutral,
inclusive language is so important.

256
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,875
And always be gender neutral
in your communication.

257
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:16,775
Um, nowadays when it comes to names
being used, and then also how they're

258
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:22,505
spelled, if you're talking to someone
outside of the us, like say if someone

259
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:27,455
has name for, um, more American cell
names, someone has the name of Peyton

260
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:31,565
or Shannon or Shelby, um, Carol.

261
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,690
Different names like that.

262
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,389
It could be either a male or
female in those names, because I

263
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:46,100
actually know, um, people in both
genders with all of those names.

264
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,659
So.

265
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:56,855
And oftentimes if you're like, hi, I think
that's a guy and you email him like Mr.

266
00:19:56,855 --> 00:20:00,485
Michaels and they come
back and know I am a Mrs.

267
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:06,215
When you do that type of
guessing, ended up wrong.

268
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:11,705
It really breaks down the level
of trust in the communication.

269
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:15,545
But if you use some general
neutral language, you won't

270
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,205
ever have those issues.

271
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,020
And then also using pet
names that are gendered.

272
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,040
Like guys, dude, lady, darling, honey, Mr.

273
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,909
Sugar pie.

274
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,310
And those type of words can be
considered demeaning to other people.

275
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,570
And like I've even seen if you
call someone miss, who is a more

276
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,120
mature of woman will sometimes
think that, oh, you must think

277
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,889
less of me just calling me a miss.

278
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,389
They acting like I'm young and dumb.

279
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,870
So if you're completely opening your word.

280
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,205
You will keep that trust
within that communication.

281
00:20:56,105 --> 00:21:01,895
Now proper wording can be like, Hey,
y'all, that's a big one in a way with us.

282
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:06,335
Um, word pressers, calling them
by name or referring to them

283
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,135
by their title is always good.

284
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,755
Uh, Hey, you is not really a good
one because that can be more of

285
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,815
like a demanding phrase, but.

286
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:19,175
Whatever language you use is
always to make sure it's open.

287
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:26,884
And if in question with someone most
of the time, if you say I don't mean

288
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:32,405
to be intrusive, however, would you
mind sharing with me your pronouns?

289
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:38,945
Because you're taking respect to them
on asking and not assuming that we'll

290
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:43,295
tend to build trust with them instead
of again, guessing and possibly being.

291
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,180
And then being inclusive in your
conversation, always keep that circle open

292
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,990
with people and riff refrain from using
comments or remarks in a group setting

293
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,600
of, can you guys help these ladies?

294
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,900
Um, the sentence can not only implies
that the lady is helpless, but it's

295
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,690
also unfair to the guys on the team.

296
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,990
Um, now, if you was to be like,
Hey, this person and call them

297
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,420
by name is having an issue.

298
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,060
Is there someone who could help just
those change in those two words of

299
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:29,480
person and someone can make some,
the person who needs a help not feel.

300
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,550
Like they are less than now, not only with
using the inclusiveness of genders, but

301
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:44,120
also in levels of intelligence or ease,
we should not be using because like, if

302
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,739
someone comes to your, the problem that
says like, Hey, my website's not loading.

303
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:49,880
I can't get it to work.

304
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,100
And someone comes back and
says, oh, that's a simple fix.

305
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,239
I can get that done in a hot.

306
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,740
Saying stuff like that, that it's easy.

307
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,210
I can get it done in a second.

308
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,540
Kind of will make the other
person feel like, oh, I must be

309
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,080
dumb since you're saying this
is easy or that this is child's.

310
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:11,705
'cause, you can make them feel less
than what they are because all of us

311
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:15,995
are really intelligent at many things
and might not be so great in others.

312
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:21,815
Like I'm really good on with WordPress
and working, um, on customer experience.

313
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:29,765
But if you handed me I, um, box that
says, build this rocket ship, it

314
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:33,935
might not even get off the ground
because that's not my expertise, but.

315
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:39,170
Am I all around lesson because I
don't know how they built the rocket.

316
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,630
No, because I do Excel and other things.

317
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,570
Another thought when it comes to
effective communication, that's

318
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:56,000
not really talked about is having
accountability in your words, in your

319
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,940
actions and in your communication.

320
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,170
One of the biggest ones that is
hard to kind of switch from is

321
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,490
when some question in real quick
to be like, I don't know when you

322
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,910
say just, I don't know, it's rare.

323
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,070
It's very dismissive, um, to the
other person, because it's almost

324
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,490
saying like, I don't care what
you're asking because I don't know.

325
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,600
And I'm not going to try to find out.

326
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah.

327
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,740
If you change that language and say that
you're not sure right now, but you can

328
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,570
try to find the answer for them, or you
can request some time to do it, or you

329
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,370
can speak so you can speak to someone else
who might know the answer or send them to

330
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,139
the person who you think might know that.

331
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:43,230
Yes.

332
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:50,764
And it's all because anytime you w
we, you, me, all of us have an issue.

333
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,335
So not really the issue we want
to dwell on, but we want to

334
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:56,135
find the solutions for that.

335
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:01,505
And so when we are in the businesses,
like we are, when it comes to, uh, working

336
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:06,605
in WordPress, building websites, um,
fixing websites, hosting websites, we

337
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:12,185
are in a solution based business because
we're there to offer a product or a sir,

338
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:21,245
And then we should not use
qualifying works and you know,

339
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,865
the no ifs, no buts aloud.

340
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,995
I don't take this personally,
but, or I just wanted you to know,

341
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:32,375
or I know what you're thinking.

342
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:38,945
However, and in my absolute
one that I load is it.

343
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:43,385
Trying to give their response
and be like, just cyan.

344
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:49,655
That drives me crazy because
the qualifiers exist for

345
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:51,155
pretty much every situation.

346
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:55,505
And in a way, if there's not one
nowadays almost make up ones.

347
00:25:56,045 --> 00:26:00,905
And when you're using them, it
can totally drive people up a

348
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:03,845
wall and it can make people feel.

349
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:12,935
Devalued less than not as smart and that
their feelings and thoughts don't count.

350
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:22,384
But if we acknowledge them going back into
talking about, um, using the empathy and

351
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:27,304
the effective words and just hearing the
people and saying that they are there for.

352
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:33,275
Uh, like a lot of us have had
times where we're just having

353
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,255
a day and we just want to vent.

354
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:38,975
We just want to yell about it, get it off
her chest, and we'll be a happier person.

355
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:43,804
And usually you'll have a couple
of people that you can do that too.

356
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,835
And they're like, girl, I'm
here for you are abroad.

357
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:48,665
Why we good?

358
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:50,855
And they just let you let it all out.

359
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:52,594
Validate your feelings.

360
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:58,505
You could move on, but when you do
have people where you do go try to

361
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:03,695
just vent and get it all out, and then
as soon as they get it up, they're

362
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,615
like, well, I've had days like that.

363
00:27:06,215 --> 00:27:07,325
Well, I've done this well.

364
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,785
I, I it's devalued.

365
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:12,844
That person's communication.

366
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:16,715
And it's again, taking away the trust
out of it because later on, they

367
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:22,025
might not come to you to vent with
a question with an issue, because

368
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:26,284
they're going to feel like if they
do come to you, it's just going to be

369
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:31,355
an invalidated conversation and we're
not going to get in, in the solutions.

370
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,134
And then on top of that
is not have excuses.

371
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:41,225
Everyone is busy.

372
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:43,174
Everyone has a lot on their plates.

373
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:47,195
Everyone's over-capacity, especially these
days, everyone's going 200 miles an hour

374
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:51,995
and everyone's got something going on
that they're not even telling you about.

375
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:58,565
How many of us tend to hide when we're
having a bad day, tend to hide when we're

376
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,174
hurting both physically or emotionally.

377
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,980
And we don't show it and
not everyone knows everyone.

378
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,699
Else's stories.

379
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:11,750
There's always something that's
not being really shared because

380
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,250
we don't know everyone's story.

381
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,580
We've not walked in everyone's shoes,
but we are all here to work together.

382
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,759
We're all here to get to the same place in
a way we're all here to succeed, to grow.

383
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,529
And if you need assistance, just ask.

384
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:35,945
There's always going to be someone there
to help you be it mentally, physically

385
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:42,155
in, um, mental health and physical
health and professional and impersonal.

386
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,775
There's always going to be someone there.

387
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:48,094
That's part of the thing that big
orange heart is for is to be there for

388
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:51,665
people to help people grow, to help
people succeed, to help people have

389
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:55,855
better mental health in there, people
that have the back, but the excuse.

390
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:58,114
Won't get you anywhere.

391
00:28:58,324 --> 00:28:59,764
It won't get the work done.

392
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:04,565
It just either will keep you at the
same spot if you're making excuses or

393
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:09,514
it will actually make you move back
in life because the excuses gives

394
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,435
you a chance to not move forward.

395
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:16,114
Like, you know, the I'm too
busy to do this, or that's not a

396
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:17,915
priority or something like that.

397
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:21,424
And it's fine to have
things not as a priority.

398
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:22,745
Just, I don't know.

399
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:29,525
Well, it's okay to tell someone that
is not a priority for me right now.

400
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,554
And it's actually better.

401
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:33,995
And you build more trust.

402
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:39,725
If you tell someone that is not a priority
for me right now, instead of just saying

403
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:44,945
I'm too busy or making the excuse, pushing
it about because the more excuses that

404
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:48,365
are made, the more distrust there is,

405
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:52,595
there are no.

406
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,679
First in the blame game.

407
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,290
This is a big one.

408
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,889
When it comes.

409
00:29:57,889 --> 00:30:02,179
If you are working in a company
with a bunch of people are, even if

410
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:06,650
you're just working on any type of
collaboration, it's always good to

411
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,179
refrain from passing the blame or the
responsibility or the work onto someone

412
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:16,190
else, unless they are, uh, agreeing to.

413
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,889
Unless they know about it beforehand,
because again, we're all here to get

414
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,600
to the final destination together.

415
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:30,949
And I have seen where there'll be
a number of coworkers, possibly in

416
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,360
different departments on a call with.

417
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,395
And there might be an issue.

418
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:40,324
And I have seen some co-workers
who will throw another one on the

419
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:42,395
bus, whether it's right or wrong.

420
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:47,795
I've seen some times where a
person will say, if someone from

421
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:53,375
the other department's fault
for dropping the ball on a time.

422
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,090
Sensitive situation.

423
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,810
And it was actually the person
throwing the blinds fault because they

424
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,450
didn't carry over the communication.

425
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:08,150
But when we kind of take ownership
in it and instead of being like,

426
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,280
I'm sorry, we didn't get to it.

427
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,929
They didn't get to it.

429
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,300
Just be like, thank you for the reminder.

430
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,870
We will make sure that gets done
for you because we're all here

431
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,580
to get to the final destination.

432
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:26,929
And when it comes to someone asking you
for help, especially in the world for,

433
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,429
with the people who are developers,
coders, engineers, who tend to end up

434
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,310
having to work on code somebody else.

435
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:41,525
Now say like someone else build a
website and then you took it over

436
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,565
two years later to help maintain it.

437
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,195
And you have to fix some CSS issues on it.

438
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,505
You wouldn't tell that client.

439
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:50,885
I didn't write that code.

440
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:52,325
So I'm not helping you with it.

441
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:54,395
No, it's your solution.

442
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:58,535
Now it's your purpose now to get that
solution for them since they are with you.

443
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:02,285
And since we are a solution-based society.

444
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,180
We should always be there to help
people along the way, because

445
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:14,210
also to the person who, um, did
it might not be around anymore.

446
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,670
And then another thing that can
set people pull back and trust

447
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,320
is like, that's not my job.

448
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:32,125
Because most companies, most freelancers,
most, anyone who works in the service type

449
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:37,465
industry, whether it be in WordPress or
tech or whether it be restaurants, retail,

450
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,645
we're all there to create solutions.

451
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:42,355
We're all there to help people.

452
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:47,665
We're all there to take on whatever
it is, our service, our product is.

453
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:52,705
And your company, your freelanced,
your community, you're all.

454
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:57,665
To do the work together and to get to
the same goal, whether it be at your

455
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:05,255
company of 50 people at your word camp,
or a word Fest with a hundred volunteers,

456
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,145
we're all there to get to the same goal.

457
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:13,295
And even in the communities and
everyone on earth, the more we do

458
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,875
work together, the better we are.

459
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:18,125
And when we.

460
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:21,875
Stay humble about things
and we help people.

461
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:23,675
We're not being arrogant.

462
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:27,845
We're not, you know, in a way, some
people being lazy now on the flip side

463
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:33,665
of this, always be there to help always
be humble, always be kind, but take

464
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:35,975
care of yourself to remember yourself.

465
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:41,075
Like I mentioned before of, if something
does get too much of saying, this is

466
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:45,335
not a priority anymore, and I need
to take care of myself, but it's all

467
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,105
about the words you choose to use.

468
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:54,005
And in every everywhere, professionally,
we've all dealt with, as I shouldn't

469
00:33:54,005 --> 00:34:00,095
say attitudes and escalation and
Zen attitudes can be from coworkers.

470
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:05,195
They can be from, um, clients
that can be really from anywhere

471
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:12,395
now as the person, when it comes to
dealing with an issue, especially

472
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:13,475
if it's a professional one.

473
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,875
Check your attitude at the door.

474
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:21,515
My step grandfather used to say he is the,
well, you would use a little more colorful

475
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:27,155
language than what I'm going to use,
but he would say to, there only should

476
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:33,095
be one Butthead in the conversation,
because if there's two people who have

477
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:38,405
the are in an aggressive, combative mood,
nothing's going to get accomplished.

478
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:43,085
And sometimes you would have to
take the higher road and check your

479
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:47,945
attitude to get to that solution to
de escalate that agitated person.

480
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:55,925
Sometimes it takes a lot of effort to pull
out your attitude from the conversation.

481
00:34:56,225 --> 00:35:00,005
However, if your bolt just butting
heads at the same time, there's

482
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,385
never going to be a solution for.

483
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,920
And like it says on the thing, a
bad attitude is like a flat tire.

484
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,780
You can't go anywhere until you change it.

485
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,040
You have to fully fill yourself
back up with the good attitudes

486
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,250
with the joy to progress.

487
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,090
Because as long as you're fighting is kind
of like you see in the movies with the

488
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:26,300
two ramps locking horns and they can never
get apart because they're just so at it.

489
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:33,845
Yeah, escalation is, do happen
and they can't be helped.

490
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:39,695
And some people just, they, I
swear they like having them, but

491
00:35:39,695 --> 00:35:44,884
oftentimes it's just because of, um,
miscommunication and it can be resolved.

492
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:51,275
And when you are in a team
with people or there's other

493
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,645
people with, um, you can go to.

494
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:59,015
Sometimes it's that other way
of presenting information makes

495
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:03,065
it fixed between, um, I've
also Peter and I at thrive.

496
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:09,035
If we notice that a client is either as
an understanding or getting agitated for

497
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:14,615
like something I would say, I would ask
Peter to come in and pretty much say the

498
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:17,705
same thing in his own words or vice versa.

499
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:19,955
And usually it takes
care of the situation.

500
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,165
Now, if you are a team of one, yeah.

501
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,920
Reach out like on Twitter, or
if you're in like post status of

502
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,180
the ladies of WordPress slack or
something like that, where you can

503
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,950
bounce ideas off of one another, um,
to help out with that escalation.

504
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,240
As a matter of fact, I had.

505
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,190
Last week, a friend of mine in the
WordPress community to call me.

506
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,860
And, um, because she was having an
issues with the client and what's, um,

507
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,270
who was wanting to cancel their project
and pretty much take their files and

508
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,880
run of stuff that she's already built.

509
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,690
And we talked about it
for about a half an hour.

510
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,920
It was like, no, honey, if
you built it, they pay for it.

511
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,490
Or they don't get.

512
00:37:02,325 --> 00:37:05,145
To after the call, she's like,
that's what I was thinking.

513
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:09,435
And it felt so good just to have
someone to run that by with.

514
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:14,504
Um, cause again, you're just never
alone in that, but if all those feels

515
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:18,644
it's okay to fire a client, it is okay
to remove yourself from the situation.

516
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,264
Because if you can see, it's
just not getting anywhere.

517
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:25,504
Um, like say if it's a client that.

518
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:31,295
The money they paying you is
not equal to the level of what

519
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,035
drama you're dealing with.

520
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:37,145
Feel free to divorce them or
fire them, whatever you call it.

521
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:43,835
There's a couple of clients we've co we've
said divorce on because they were, it was

522
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,694
a toxic marriage professional mirrors.

523
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:46,325
That was for sure.

524
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:51,995
And often with that too, is when you do.

525
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:58,295
Fire them as a client, you don't even have
to have that as a quote, bad situation.

526
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:04,384
I've seen a number of times in agencies
where it just has a point that it's like,

527
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,485
this relationship is no longer good.

528
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:11,315
And a lot of us are friends with
other agencies and other, you know,

529
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,964
personalities with the agencies.

530
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:14,515
And there's no reason why you.

531
00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:19,044
Reach out to another one and be
like, Hey, I have this client where

532
00:38:19,044 --> 00:38:21,894
does not really seeing eye to eye,
but they seem to be great people.

533
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:24,354
Would you like to meet
her, refer them to you.

534
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:29,934
And quite often when they do
switch to different, um, team

535
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:33,654
different, uh, company, it ends
up being a good relationship.

536
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,994
Sometimes it's not, but oftentimes it is.

537
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:41,244
And professional and
technical communication.

538
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:48,694
But when it, when you are working
on like coding something or, um,

539
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:52,355
any kind of a client community
professional communication, it is

540
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,455
always good to keep a paper trail.

541
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:59,435
And I say paper trail in quotes,
because any more now you're doing

542
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:05,615
more online paper trail with email
are your project management software,

543
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:08,075
um, your CRM, something like that.

544
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,775
So it's digital paper.

545
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:17,314
Um, and document all your work,
all the communications that's done.

546
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:24,514
So you can always have something to come
back to something, um, that you can either

547
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:31,535
prove or not reinvent the wheel for say
like you have a site and found out here's

548
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,825
the one that actually happened to me.

549
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:35,014
We have a client who has.

550
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:43,990
Detailed, um, gravity farm's set up and,
um, it's in some of the products it has.

551
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:48,560
Um, some of the form fields, it
has links to the products in them.

552
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:55,160
And we found out the hard way that
when you run a search and replacing the

553
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,279
database to change URL links, it does not
change them in the gravity form fields.

554
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:05,689
And so we had to go back through
all the forms with all the products

555
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:09,140
and them and change out from
the dev links to the live links.

556
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:16,229
And had I not put that in the comments
at that task and had to do it again,

557
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:23,189
that could have taken us, you know,
20, 30, 2 minutes, two hours to

558
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,469
remember that that's what had happened.

559
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,949
But if we documented it in like
sitting there, it's like, Hey, I

560
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,659
remember something like this happening.

561
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:31,919
And you do a search surgeon.

562
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:37,414
Um, PM software and it pops up that
task that, oh, I get won't do it.

563
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,414
I have to manually replace them all.

564
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,364
It saved you a lot of time.

565
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:48,454
And then also when you document
everything you do with other people, if

566
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:53,854
there is an issue arise, you can pull
up that email, pull up that task, pull

567
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:57,784
up that whatever, and be like, this is
what was said, this is what was done.

568
00:40:58,474 --> 00:41:02,584
Um, Fan of Denzel Washington films.

569
00:41:02,914 --> 00:41:08,854
There was a movie called, um, training
day and one of his quotes was, it's not

570
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:10,894
what you know is what you can prove.

571
00:41:11,404 --> 00:41:16,414
And that has really struck with
me professionally, because if you

572
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:19,324
can't prove that you did it, if
you can't prove that you said.

573
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:25,999
That can sometimes come back to bite you,
especially when there's escalations of

574
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:28,129
issues of what was done, what wasn't done.

575
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:32,870
But if you have that paper
trail, it's proven, and there

576
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,249
can not be any arguments on it.

577
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,569
And that also builds trust that
you can pull up those kinds

578
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:39,769
of things at a later time.

579
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,689
Especially with, since we work in the
world of internet, there's always on

580
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:53,569
looking, especially if you're using
Chrome and browsers and you should treat

581
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,439
each communication like your grandmother
and the person you look up to most is

582
00:41:57,439 --> 00:42:02,089
reading every thing that you write,
because you want to keep that respect.

583
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:04,129
You want to keep the honor,
you want to keep that trust.

584
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:09,904
And in the digital world, it is way too
easy for something we do not want to

585
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:12,004
come public to be unleashed in the world.

586
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:16,774
If you want to question that you can
always ask him Kardashians are parasols.

587
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:20,644
They will be the first to tell
you that sometimes things that

588
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:21,964
they do not want to get out.

589
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:22,444
Sure.

590
00:42:22,444 --> 00:42:26,434
Well, and then questions.

591
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:30,454
Cathy Tibbles: Hi.

592
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,564
Thank you, Michele.

593
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:39,335
Michele Butcher-Jones: Hello, I
accidentally did a "derr" moment

594
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:47,524
because my website for my slides are
actually https://mlb.pw/wordfast22.

595
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,999
Back in 2016, change my last
name from Butcher to Jones.

596
00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:00,709
And obviously I have finally hit the
point where instead of not thinking

597
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,399
and using my maiden name, I have
not thought in used my married name.

598
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,289
It's only taken what?

599
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:07,939
Six years.

600
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:14,240
Cathy Tibbles: Well, we have the link
across the bottom of the screen now,

601
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,339
so everybody can find the slide deck.

602
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,399
Michele Butcher-Jones: Thank you so much.

603
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,854
Misty Combs: Thank you so much,
Michele, for your presentation.

604
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:26,584
It was a lot of good information.

605
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,924
I'm sure a lot of it we'll be
able to put to use right away.

606
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:36,694
Um, if we have time for one question in
a, in the tech community, there's so many

607
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,824
people who are just very painfully shy.

608
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:43,324
Do you have any words of wisdom
for either improving or starting

609
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:47,524
communication with somebody who might be
very shy and hard to pull information?

610
00:43:49,924 --> 00:43:51,785
Michele Butcher-Jones: Work on it slowly.

611
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:56,494
Um, and keep your circle open for it.

612
00:43:56,615 --> 00:44:01,144
Um, like in a lot of times, you see
if you, uh, way back when we were

613
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:05,914
still going to in-person events, a lot
of people were standing to the sides

614
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:08,914
and you can see on the, on the side
of, they kind of would like to talk,

615
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:11,314
but not for sure of how to do it.

616
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:15,035
Um, kind of go pull them in.

617
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,785
At a slower speed.

618
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:21,875
I've just kinda be like, Hey,
would you like to come join

619
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,255
us and do have more than.

620
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:32,944
Smaller type questions of what do you
do in WordPress or, um, what are you

621
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:39,544
most interested in if you're like in a
setting like this, to do those questions

622
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:47,495
that are easy to answer and then
progress into a more meaty conversation.

623
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:53,354
There's a lot of times, once you get the
ball rolling with the more shyer people.

624
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:57,244
They tend to open up, but if you
kind of just jump into it more of

625
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:01,474
like the Energizer bunny with, Hey,
my name is Michele, how are you?

626
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:01,984
What do you do?

627
00:45:01,984 --> 00:45:02,984
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:04,935
They're like, nope.

629
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:10,325
Cathy Tibbles: What about
the open-ended questions?

630
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:12,904
But do you think that's where
it would come into play?

631
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:19,504
Michele Butcher-Jones: The open
ended are, tend to be harder for the

632
00:45:19,535 --> 00:45:25,549
more, uh, Quieter types to answer
then the more easier, yes, no.

633
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,729
Um, quick questions, because the
more time they, it takes a person to

634
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:37,370
think when it comes to on the being
shy, the more it tends to, they tend

635
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,169
to question themselves at first.

636
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,339
But if it's more of something
where they can be confident in

637
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:47,930
answering, like, you know, um,
what's going to be your favorite.

638
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:56,075
Topic today or, um, or like, you
know, for wearing like a sh um,

639
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:59,954
Yoast shirt and coming up and be
like, oh, do you work for Yoast?

640
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:02,374
And they're like, actually I do.

641
00:46:02,374 --> 00:46:03,845
And kind of bring that out loud.

642
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:10,119
Misty Combs: Also in the WordPress
community, we are a really diverse

643
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,419
group and very broadly distributed.

644
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:18,129
Do you have any words of wisdom for
improving or opening communication

645
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:21,159
between people who may not
have the same native language?

646
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:25,809
Michele Butcher-Jones: Um, on
that one it's there, it's just

647
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:28,269
a lot of keep your circle open.

648
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:35,044
Um, both figuratively and physically,
if you're standing there and you're

649
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:39,874
having a conversation and that's very
closed, people won't want to try to

650
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:45,634
join in, but if you stand where you're
more like this, it gives that opening

651
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:51,035
for people to come in and also like
you're standing there and you're more.

652
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:56,734
And even in the words that you use in
the tone of voice, you have the more

653
00:46:56,734 --> 00:47:03,245
closed off the more tight you are the
less people will want to interact, but

654
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:07,714
if you're more open, you see more hand
movement, more talking, more smiling.

655
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:12,305
Um, people tend to go talk
to those types of people.

656
00:47:12,305 --> 00:47:18,904
Like there is actual, um, studies
that's been done, where if you have

657
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:23,644
a room full of different types of
people, And you put a child in that

658
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:28,894
room, they will almost always figure
out who that person who was like the

659
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:36,964
kindergarten teacher or the nurse, or
S um, the, um, um, policemen or someone

660
00:47:36,964 --> 00:47:43,114
like that, who has that temperament
of always helping are always teaching.

661
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:49,355
Um, they will find out those people who,
um, to go and talk to, to go and ask,

662
00:47:49,774 --> 00:47:56,925
instead of someone who just kind of gives
off that vibe of kind of closed off-ness.

663
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:02,475
Misty Combs: And any words of
wisdom or advice in more digital

664
00:48:02,475 --> 00:48:06,165
communication between people who might
not share the same native language?

665
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:13,075
Michele Butcher-Jones: Use precise
words and do not use slang.

666
00:48:14,715 --> 00:48:15,524
Cathy Tibbles: Yeah, that's a good one.

667
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:18,379
Michele Butcher-Jones: If you were
trying to talk to people without other

668
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,129
who's in other languages, because they
might not understand what you mean.

669
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:29,330
Um, like I'm trying to think
of, what's a good slang phrase.

670
00:48:30,919 --> 00:48:33,950
Out of someone like getting
aside to buy something, I'd

671
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,209
be like, shut the front door.

672
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:36,140
You did not

673
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,269
say that to like someone from,
um, like South Africa or India.

674
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:46,850
And they're like, I did not open the door.

675
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:50,870
Yes, I did do it.

676
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:55,879
Where if you say that to someone
like from the south of America, You

677
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:58,879
might get a response like yes I did.

678
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:06,769
Um, but if you use more of the
literal phrases and not sling is

679
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:12,139
your best way, because also a lot
of people will use Google translate.

680
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:16,309
And when you put the slang type
of wording in there, sometimes

681
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:17,569
Google might be like, I don't know,

682
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,419
Misty Combs: For the most intense
you covered some, um, conflict or

683
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:33,950
dispute situations, but do you have any
go-to phrases to help diffuse those?

684
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:39,079
Not putting you on the spot?

685
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:43,140
Michele Butcher-Jones: Now, the
first thing I do is number one,

686
00:49:43,169 --> 00:49:46,410
I do not apologize for anything,
unless it was actually my fault.

687
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,279
Um, just because.

688
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:56,659
If it's not your fault, it's not
something that you did or your team did.

689
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:00,259
You don't want really want
to take liability of it.

690
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:05,109
However, if you change it in, like,
someone's like, I can't believe

691
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,099
this wasn't done, blah, blah, blah.

692
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:10,579
If this isn't done like
today, we're gonna fire you.

693
00:50:11,419 --> 00:50:16,039
Um, whether it be client or boss,
um, always give the solutions

694
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:21,350
and be like, okay, um, Thank you.

695
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,770
You can even say, thank you
for reminding me on this.

696
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:26,629
It did slip through the cracks.

697
00:50:26,629 --> 00:50:27,589
We will get on this.

698
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:31,580
Or, you know, we had a site that just
completely blew up because it had

699
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,229
a hundred gigs, a mile we're on it.

700
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:34,700
And you know, that took priority.

701
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:41,359
Um, always kind of give the
solutions instead of excuses, always.

702
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:42,529
Okay.

703
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:45,975
You know, we'll get this done for you.

704
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:51,375
And it kind of goes back to setting those
boundaries, setting those expectations.

705
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:57,944
At first, to hear like a lot of
times we will have setbacks on things

706
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,404
and like I'll message the client.

707
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:03,734
Cause like I already said, like
I would give them a response back

708
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:05,505
Tuesday by end of day in Tuesday.

709
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:07,654
We haven't even started it.

710
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:14,104
I'll message you back and be like,
uh, due to, um, capacity issues.

711
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:15,694
We are still working on this.

712
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:17,164
I will give you another update.

713
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:17,734
X.

714
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:22,084
I always say I'll give you an update
instead of it will be done by because.

715
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:26,795
Everyone here in the tech world
knows the whole Murphy's law of

716
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,504
what can go wrong will go wrong.

717
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:31,024
And especially if you try to
deploy anything on a Friday,

718
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:35,705
you say update.

719
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:39,575
I never give definitives because
Ooh, there's something we'll

720
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,194
go two minutes beforehand.

721
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:42,815
Um,

722
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:45,125
Misty Combs: thank you
again for everything.

723
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:46,535
We're a bit over time.

724
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:47,225
Um,

725
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:55,115
Michele Butcher-Jones: I do want
to quit, put, put a quick thing out

726
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,455
because of Allie coming on next.

727
00:51:57,694 --> 00:52:00,725
Yes, she did give me a black eye in 2019.

728
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:03,904
It was quite beautiful.

729
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,095
It was done by makeup.

730
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:10,325
Uh, she didn't actually clock
me because we did the Halloween

731
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,414
party and I went as a beat up.

732
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:19,685
Uh, hockey player, this hears
actually I've got recited.

733
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:22,115
No, Allie Nimmons did
not beat me up again.

734
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:26,734
Cathy Tibbles: Well, we
can give her a hard time,

735
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:29,745
Misty Combs: Michele.

00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:35,224
