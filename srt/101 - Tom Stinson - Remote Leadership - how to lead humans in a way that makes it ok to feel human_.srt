I am absolutely thrilled to have the

Whether you are watching live

00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,905
I'm thrilled to be with you.

35
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:12,585
My name is Tom.

36
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,605
I live on the sunshine coast in
beautiful Australia with my wife,

37
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:21,045
Ellie, and we have three wonderful
children who drive us completely mad.

38
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,200
And adult called peanut who is
extremely lazy, even for a whip.

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,090
It, I also get the opportunity to
help shape and strive to create

40
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,960
an exceptional experience for the
community members of XWP today.

41
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,950
Uh, I want to share about a topic
that I'm really passionate about.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,020
One that I hope everyone will be
able to connect with a topic that

43
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm hopeful will encourage it.

44
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:56,065
To continue moving in a positive direction
with how we approach, define and handle

45
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,545
the term leadership in the remote space.

46
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,765
I've titled my talk today.

47
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:08,425
Remote leadership, how to lead humans in
a way that makes it okay to feel human.

48
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:15,235
I remember when I first stepped into a
leadership role at one of my first jobs,

49
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:18,085
not XWP, my manager pulled me aside.

50
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:23,155
Uh, just remember Tom, you're no
longer one of just, you know, only

51
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:26,245
one of the boys, unfortunately.

52
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,855
Yes, it was a very male dominant place.

53
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:35,725
But the comment I had it, a couple of
internal reactions to this, firstly, a

54
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:41,905
sense of understanding as in I understood
what they were trying to say that with

55
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:46,495
leadership, there is a new range of
responsibility with new expectations.

56
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:51,505
I couldn't just continue in the
same manner as I had previously,

57
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:58,225
there was a shift expected, but
then I had also another reaction.

58
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,075
And then this one was an ease about it.

59
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:06,985
Didn't really like the idea that
my relationships had to change,

60
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:13,015
that there was now an expected gap
between those who I once worked with

61
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,735
and who I was now expected to lead.

62
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:20,905
And this second reaction has stuck
with me for years since that moment.

63
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:25,765
Why do we have to have this
degree of separation between

64
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:27,265
people that we are working with?

65
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:35,245
The relational side of the
relationship is now irrelevant.

66
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:42,025
And the relationship is now solely based
on your position or your role, your title.

67
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,909
I wonder if you've been in a similar
situation where you find the dynamics

68
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:54,190
of relationships have been changed
because of a change to title or role

69
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:02,289
either to you or someone else say,
I think the problem is that we we've

70
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:08,530
lived in a world where unfortunately,
dominantly, titles and roles have been

71
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,659
the cornerstone of the work experience.

72
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:17,424
With the value of a person at work
is looped through the eyes of their

73
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:21,534
role, their KPIs and their outcomes.

74
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:27,505
And to be fair, like on paper,
I guess that makes sense.

75
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:33,684
But if there's one thing I hope we can
all agree on, there's a big difference

76
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,115
between the paper version of life in life.

77
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:44,080
My personal belief and hope is that
there is a real shift towards that.

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,569
Cornerstone becoming the makeup
and values of the individual.

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,360
I believe that with the rising prominence
of remote work, many, many businesses

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,809
organizations, startups, actioning
on the realization that people cannot

81
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,780
be looked at as just titles roles.

82
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,230
The cogs of a machine, but they
must be viewed and treated as

83
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,169
individuals that are human beings.

84
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:19,030
This is because the preexisting
blurred lines of work in

85
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,830
life are becoming clearer.

86
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,689
And then as I said, lines, plural,
because I don't think there is just

87
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:28,569
one line with work and then life.

88
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,000
And there's all the twined.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,809
It's a mess.

90
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,640
The truth is.

91
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,175
Um, more than ever.

92
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:44,395
The toll of life is visibly affecting
work and that's not a negative.

93
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:48,595
There's been many moments throughout
history where the toll of life has

94
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:54,745
been overwhelmed, overwhelming, but
there is barely been a response.

95
00:07:55,555 --> 00:08:02,784
The difference today, I believe is that
we are all seeing inside lives and homes.

96
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,465
Of everyone else during these
calls that are happening.

97
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:14,544
And we actually visibly
seen the tall in play.

98
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:21,534
So the natural effect, and this is
why it perhaps isn't all negative

99
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:27,205
is that the need to acknowledge
this, the effects of light.

100
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,155
And work.

101
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:37,074
So all out humanity is growing in further
in force and this shift will continue

102
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:44,125
to happen as more and more of us take
responsibility for it, just because we

103
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:48,655
may not have a leadership role within
the structure of an organization.

104
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:51,625
That doesn't mean we can't
be a leader for change.

105
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,520
Those of us that are, and have been
working in a remote freelance type of

106
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,500
arrangement for a while now, I'm hoping
we've been privileged to experience

107
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,340
being treated and seen as human beings.

108
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,380
I believe several remote companies
either began because of the notion

109
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,850
that we can be live, work, wherever
it makes sense for the individually.

110
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,390
Or either because a company sought
after the diverse contributions that

111
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,810
come from having team members all
around the world, bringing their

112
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,439
culture, their diverse outlook to
the team, both of these recognize and

113
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,470
celebrate the individuality of humans.

114
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,640
There are other reasons for
being in the remote space.

115
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,060
I know.

116
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,740
And even if initially the intentions
were good doesn't mean they still are.

117
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,579
Yeah.

118
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:51,535
In the remote space, we are well
positioned to lead in a way that

119
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:55,495
respects values and promotes being human.

120
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:59,694
And this is what I specifically
want to speak about today.

121
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:07,464
A leader's role is to make it
feel okay to be, and feel here.

122
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:13,479
And to clarify, I don't want to throw
the baby out with the bath water roles.

123
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,000
KPIs outcomes are vitally important.

124
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,160
Good leadership is connecting where
we want to go to the understanding

125
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,140
of the individual with that
individual's capabilities and

126
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,630
limitations are accounted for.

127
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:34,839
And that is the same as if you
were leading down, up or around.

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,740
So, what does it mean to be human?

129
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,180
Well, technically you don't need to do
anything to be human, but I think what

130
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,120
it means to be in, uh, an ecosystem with
humans to be working, living, supporting

131
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:03,740
celebrate together is to first acknowledge
and then learn to work with those.

132
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:08,995
That unite us and those things
that are unique to all of us.

133
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:16,345
Now that could be a whole list of things
that are unite or are unique to us.

134
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:21,355
But I just want to focus on two key points
for each and I'm going to be honest.

135
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:27,055
I feel these, these are pretty basic,
but I also feel they get forgotten a lot.

136
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,085
So I'm goona to start with
the things that united us.

137
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:41,890
And they are that we are emotional
and intelligent beings, emotions.

138
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,780
They drive us and lead us both
consciously and unconsciously.

139
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:51,310
There's so much wonderful research
and evidence today about the, how

140
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,060
the emotional side of us is one
of the leading factors in how we

141
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,829
make decisions, how we respond to
circumstances and how we live out.

142
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,970
So as a leader or team member,
we need to remind ourselves daily

143
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,190
that who we are working alongside
of people coming together with a

144
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,220
whole range of emotional statuses.

145
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,850
So our leaders response is that
they have to, and I repeat, they

146
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,980
have to take ownership of the
emotional atmosphere they created.

147
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,574
With all these emotions and
everybody bringing it in, we

148
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:37,255
need to take responsibility for
the atmosphere that we create.

149
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:42,385
And it's no longer acceptable
to expect the individuals leave

150
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:47,035
their emotions at the, at the
metaphorical door as they enter work.

151
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,444
It is no longer acceptable
to blame an individual for

152
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:52,944
the emotional response that.

153
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,790
A leader has to take ownership
and responsibility for the

154
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,670
emotional atmosphere they create.

155
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:09,489
And that needs to be a safe place
where individuals feel their

156
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:13,569
emotions are valid and respected

157
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:17,499
a few things.

158
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,579
I think we can do to put into
practice to help us with this.

159
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:29,215
The first thing is, um, learn about
empathy and going beyond that is

160
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:35,635
learning about the difference between
empathy and sympathy in the book.

161
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:40,315
Uh, practical empathy, the author
Indy young says empathy is about

162
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:46,375
understanding how another person thinks
and acknowledging their reasoning

163
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:51,475
and emotions as valid, even if they
differ from your own understanding.

164
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,500
Am I going to stand?

165
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,939
That can be tough to be able to
understand and acknowledge the

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,439
reasoning behind their emotions
and not just say, okay, that's on.

167
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,100
I get that, but understand
that they are valid.

168
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:16,120
And I said, that can be tough,
but a leader's job is to

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,760
step into where it's tough.

170
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:26,695
And make it easier path for the next
person by acknowledging someone's

171
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:31,645
current situation and their emotions,
it will help create and strengthen

172
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:35,245
a positive emotional atmosphere.

173
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:40,195
A few other things simply be nice.

174
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,095
Love people over the process.

175
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:49,615
Life is too short to fall
in love with the process.

176
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,745
Fall in love with people.

177
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:59,185
One thing I have learned through many,
many failed, uh, moments in my own

178
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:09,265
leadership is this is about that is
that generally when, uh, I lost my nerve

179
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,355
or my emotions have risen to the top.

180
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:18,895
It's barely been about that very moment
or what is taking place right there.

181
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:22,915
And then, but it's because something
else has been going on in the background

182
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:27,355
and this spark, or this moment has
brought out all the emotion and that poor

183
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,725
person on the receiving end has no idea.

184
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:30,685
What's just happened.

185
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,405
See, this is actually about that.

186
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,655
And it happens more than you think.

187
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:44,665
And for ourselves, as, as, as leaders,
we need to ask and investigate moments

188
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:47,935
like these to ensure we fully grasp
the situation, whether it's happening

189
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:53,004
to us or to somebody else so that
we can respond in the right way.

190
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:57,805
And we can only do that when emotions
are okay to be shared that they're

191
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,694
not all bottled up and then explode.

192
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:06,025
There is a positive atmosphere for
people to be who they are and feeling.

193
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:08,305
How they are.

194
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:14,935
We are all emotional beings as
leaders in the remote space.

195
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:19,435
We need to remind them focus on this
because with the disconnect of human

196
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:25,015
interaction, with being all around the
world with not physically seeing somebody

197
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:32,334
in the office, it is far too easy to
forget and to not learn about this.

198
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,994
So our response is to learn everything.

199
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,099
It's not natural.

200
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,500
That actually needs to be a step to
learn about it and put it into practice.

201
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,770
So that first thing is
that we are emotional.

202
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,160
The second thing that unites us is
that we are all intelligent beings.

203
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,109
This means that we are constantly
learning and taking on new aspects

204
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,420
to consider and apply to our work.

205
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:04,510
And.

206
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,379
As a leader, we need to remind
ourselves that those we serve our team,

207
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,750
uh, growing and expanding every day
from their wins and their failures.

208
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,980
They are building upon their knowledge
and how to apply themselves in the future.

209
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,609
A leader is responsible for their,
the ease of sharing knowledge and

210
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:33,700
its application within a team,
as well as a de identifying gaps.

211
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,310
And if needed where extra possible
outside support is needed.

212
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,930
So a few things to help us with this,
uh, li uh, remote leaders response.

213
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I believe we should come with
the mindset that we want to raise

214
00:17:51,700 --> 00:18:00,370
leaders as if, as a default, don't
give tasks, give responsibility.

215
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,240
Tasks mean stay in your lane.

216
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,960
The things that, you know, the things
that I've seen you be able to do,

217
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm just wanting you to do that.

218
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,320
Do that task responsibility means explore.

219
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,960
Add your perspective to the solution.

220
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,150
Give the opportunity for people to
handle the responsibility of something

221
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,400
and learn what they can achieve.

222
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,310
Be on the confined expectations.

223
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,000
And you will raise leaders.

224
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:38,290
This will help close those gaps before
you have to look internally, externally,

225
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,250
look internally, and for this as
leaders, we need to learn about trust.

226
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:52,255
And again, in the remote space,
trust can be difficult because you

227
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:56,095
can't, you can't sneak over to their
desk to see how things are going.

228
00:18:56,095 --> 00:19:01,885
You can't be just checking in and it's,
it's natural to fear what we can't see.

229
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:07,255
I remember when I, uh, I went
on a holiday to venowado.

230
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,980
And I went snorkeling on this coral
reef and it was, it was gorgeous.

231
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,190
It was beautiful, the colors
of the fish and the coral.

232
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,220
And it was the most amazing experience,
but I slammed to the edge and, and

233
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,230
it just dropped off into the depths.

234
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,480
And I remember peering over and watching
the water go that, that darker blue

235
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,810
down to deep, deep black and my chest
just seemed to, you know, contract.

236
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
It was like this, this field.

237
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:42,805
And it was because of the
unknown it's because I couldn't

238
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,425
see what was down there.

239
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:50,065
And when there is something that
is unknown on natural reaction

240
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:54,565
is to be fearful of it, fearful
of what could be done there.

241
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:57,535
And we generally go to
the worst case scenario.

242
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:05,155
And so when we can't see things, we fear.

243
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:07,705
That they will not work out.

244
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:14,424
And we can fear that the floors of,
of our people and we all have flaws.

245
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:20,125
We fear that they will be the defining
moment or aspect of that job or that

246
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,705
task or that project or responsibility.

247
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:30,534
And then not only hurts the person
that hurts us as well, but in that

248
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:33,295
regard, giving tasks can seem easier.

249
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:42,610
However, I wanted to share a few,
uh, quotes on the value of trusting

250
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,350
people by some individuals who
are far more qualified than I am.

251
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,750
Jim Collins quoting his, his close
mentor and co-author builders here.

252
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,080
He says, look.

253
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:59,154
Think of it as upside and downside.

254
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,884
Here's the wager, what's the upside.

255
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:09,145
If you to take the bit of mistrust,
well, you'll maybe prevent yourself from

256
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,694
having one of those hurtful experiences.

257
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:13,404
And what's the downside.

258
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:16,705
The downside is trustworthy people.

259
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:18,114
You will lose them.

260
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:23,904
And the upside to trusting people
is when you find the trustworthy

261
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,034
people, they will rise to.

262
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,049
If you've ever considered the possibility
that not everybody is one or the other,

263
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:37,299
but because you trust them at that
outset, they are more likely to become

264
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,330
trustworthy because you trust them.

265
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,469
I think it's a, it's a beautiful quote.

266
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,250
And every time I read it, I
think I want to give people

267
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,489
the opportunity to rise to it.

268
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:54,115
Simon Sinek.

269
00:21:54,205 --> 00:22:00,804
One of the greatest voices on leadership
today, in my opinion, he says a team is

270
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,965
not a group of people who work together.

271
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:07,135
A team is a group of people
who trust each other.

272
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:11,784
It goes on to say, there are only
two ways to influence human behavior.

273
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:15,685
You can manipulate it
or you can inspire it.

274
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:19,284
See fear, suffocates creativity.

275
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:26,395
Honesty loyalty, wellbeing and
growth fear will suffocate the

276
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,665
collaboration of intelligent beings.

277
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:35,094
Yet trust is one of the core
principles of creating an environment

278
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:40,465
that is inspired and prepared to
rise to the challenge it faces.

279
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:46,665
And just on a side note,
I just want to say.

280
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:54,264
Nothing quite inspires and says,
I trust you like forcing screen

281
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:57,205
recording surveillance on your team.

282
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:06,694
And I hope that you're picking up
that I'm joking, strip it all back.

283
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,995
We are all emotional
and intelligent beings.

284
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:14,614
And as a leader, we need to not
only identify that within ourselves.

285
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:19,915
But recognize that within those
that we serve as leaders as well.

286
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:26,335
So we look at the things that unite
us more to look at a couple of

287
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:29,335
things that are unique to us as well.

288
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,194
And they are that we are diverse
and that we are at different

289
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:38,965
stages, looking at diverse.

290
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,820
We no longer just have multicultural
and diverse hubs within largest

291
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
towns or cities in the remote world.

292
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,380
We are multicultural and diverse.

293
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,659
There are no more boundaries to this.

294
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,920
We have a real opportunity to
lead the way in what work should

295
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,500
look like to be inclusive.

296
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,210
Provided quality.

297
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:19,645
Diverse to me to be human is to
embrace diversity, remote leaders,

298
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:24,085
response, and reminded that a
leader doesn't need a title.

299
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:33,415
But I think a leader's response to
this is, is to learn again, empathy.

300
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,085
Empathy is at the core of.

301
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,435
To learn about another person's point
of view to learn about how someone

302
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:47,725
reacts and why they're reacting
and why they feel the way they do.

303
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:56,304
And the actions we can take on is
firstly, to assess the things that

304
00:24:56,304 --> 00:25:03,054
we are responsible for and ask
ourselves, how can I be an advocate

305
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:05,995
for diversity, equality and inclusion.

306
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:11,320
And that, that, that that's, I, I know
that doesn't sound like I'm answering

307
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,330
the question, but I feel like the first
thing we need to do is ask ourselves

308
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,120
that because it all starts with us.

309
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,219
And to be honest, I'm not going to pretend
that I'm an expert on this topic at all.

310
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,989
You know, I'm a white middle-class
male raised in a Western

311
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:31,960
country, however, I'm on a.

312
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,080
And I'm going to be asking questions
and exploring this topic so that I can

313
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:44,290
unlearn a whole lot of things and then
learn how I can be a better human.

314
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:51,610
And I believe that if you are a
human leader in the remote space, you

315
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,480
should, at the very least do likewise.

316
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
Secondly, what we can do is plan.

317
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:06,025
On how we're going to be an advocate
for change and lead up in this area,

318
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:10,134
because I can promise you if you
think that this is something that is

319
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:17,094
someone else's responsibility, then
you are hiding and lead is don't hide

320
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:26,694
in embracing the diversity
of your team is, is magic.

321
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,850
Allowing everyone, the chance to speak
into an ad, their perspectives only

322
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:43,600
multiplies the experience and to do
this, as I said, learn empathy, pause,

323
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,290
and listen to your fellow humans at SWP.

324
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,050
One of our most meaningful
initiatives, our home.

325
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:58,810
These are, uh, groups, uh,
designed to provide connection and

326
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,909
support to our community members.

327
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:07,000
Um, in a real casual setting, you
know, the, the groups vary in size

328
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,040
and it made up of team members in
similar time zones yet from varying

329
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,770
places, countries, backgrounds.

330
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,040
COVID.

331
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:21,025
And these home-based is they help our
community members to build friendships,

332
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:27,054
providing a network for them to,
uh, help each other in, in personal

333
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:31,315
and professional growth, but also
to learn about each other's cultures

334
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:37,165
and to strengthen our community
and our overall culture on vexed w.

335
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:43,495
It's a wonderful place to be able to
open up your life and to share your

336
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:48,145
stories and listen to other people,
to, to journey with them, to celebrate

337
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:53,574
with them, to mourn with them, to pick
each other up, to, to cheer them on.

338
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:58,225
And it impacts our whole
working environment.

339
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:07,194
A remote leader needs to embrace
and be an advocate for diversity.

340
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:17,980
We are in the box seats to show the world
how humans can and should work together.

341
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:27,880
The second point I want to talk about
the things that are unique to us

342
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:30,880
is that we're at different stages.

343
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,920
And I believe that this sign
that goes under the radar.

344
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,570
Not just working with different
experiences that are available, but

345
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,850
also with the different life stages.

346
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:48,370
I think typically with, at office work,
it would be quite common to find people

347
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,030
who are in the same stages of life, in
the same roles, with the same level of

348
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:59,319
experience, but with remote work, The
variety of stages can be vastly different.

349
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,330
A small example, you know, the team
I get to work with, we have two

350
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:09,009
highly skilled mothers who have young
children and are still breastfeeding.

351
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,650
A female who is new to the industry
after a career change, a father who

352
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:19,179
has spent the majority of the last two
years in hospital with his daughter, a

353
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:21,670
female who is a digital nomad with her.

354
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,250
A mother who has been navigating
a career change and, uh, doing

355
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,929
at-home learning with her teenagers,
a father who is homeschooling his

356
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:33,489
young children in the mountains.

357
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,639
And then another who've really
located near some ski fields with

358
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,819
his family, just within our team.

359
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:45,429
We have many different stages of
personal and work life records.

360
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:52,525
And I'm so thrilled that the life
choices and situations of my teammates

361
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:59,335
and not considered a hindrance to
their work or ability, but actually

362
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:05,185
it is an enriching benefit to
who we are and what we can offer.

363
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:13,585
So how can a remote leader
respond to this thing?

364
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:15,174
It is about embracing the different.

365
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:22,225
Of experiences equally and adjust your
expectations to allow for multiple stages.

366
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,005
It doesn't weaken, it enhances your team.

367
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:33,085
So again, it it's about learning
trust about saying, you know what?

368
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,395
I may not understand your stage.

369
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:36,685
I know may not be there.

370
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:41,155
I don't know about your experience,
but I'm going to place trust in

371
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:44,755
you to add to this community.

372
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:53,095
The diversity in different stages
that are on offer in the remote space

373
00:30:53,875 --> 00:31:00,565
can allow us to lead in a new way
and break down some old irrelevant

374
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,125
walls that have been pulled up.

375
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:06,565
So tired.

376
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,005
I wanted to talk about that.

377
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:12,205
A leader's role is to make it feel okay.

378
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,989
To be human.

379
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,889
Okay.

380
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:22,389
And the things that unite us, but also in
the uniqueness that we bring, the things

381
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,060
that unite us were that were emotional.

382
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:30,100
And as a leader, ask yourself, how
can I create a positive emotional

383
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,370
atmosphere and learn about empathy?

384
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,429
The second thing is that we're in trouble.

385
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,469
Ask yourself, how can I
encourage collaboration?

386
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,120
And the application of
knowledge learn about trust?

387
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,670
The things that are unique
is that we are diverse.

388
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,409
Ask yourself, how can I be an advocate for
diversity, equality and inclusion, learn

389
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,860
empathy, and we're in different stages.

390
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,600
Uh, ask yourself, how do the
differences of the team bring new

391
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,340
perspectives and insights learn trust?

392
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:22,630
When my daughter was three months old,
um, we had to take her to hospital because

393
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:30,360
of an infection soon found out it was
meningitis, which is a serious infection.

394
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:30,430
The.

395
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:35,335
Which was going to resolve my
wife and Molly, having to stay

396
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:37,045
in hospital for six weeks.

397
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:42,355
And I would be at home without all
the two, while the nurses were doing

398
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:48,534
a routine check, they found a lump
in her abdomen, long story short

399
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:54,145
after tests and surgery, we found
that she had aggressive neuroblastoma

400
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:58,585
cancer and with treatment, she was
given a 50, 50 chance of surviving.

401
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:03,355
So four months old, she
started chemotherapy.

402
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:12,205
And a lot of other things I'm passionate
about treating and leading humans in a way

403
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:17,155
that makes it okay to feel human because
I was on the receiving end of this.

404
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:23,935
My work community offered all the
support that I and my family would need.

405
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,594
They allowed me space.

406
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,435
They allow me to talk.

407
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,550
They offered me support in so many
ways, but they also need that my

408
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,980
capacity was drastically reduced.

409
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,719
And the best way for me to work
was by give me lists of tasks

410
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,840
to do see responsibilities.

411
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,380
Weren't right.

412
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,650
For me at that time, the tasks were good.

413
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,650
I could come to work and
just work through them.

414
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:55,480
It felt like I was still contributing
back to my team, but then I was

415
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,920
able to be there for my family.

416
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,904
My daughter is now two
and a half years old.

417
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:12,445
The other month she was cleared
of all cancer and that we are so

418
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:16,855
excited as her parents to be at
lead her and love her in a life

419
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:18,865
that's going to be long and amazing.

420
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:25,965
But see, I, I was treated as a
human being where my emotions.

421
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:32,245
And stage work acknowledged,
accounted for and supported.

422
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:39,205
And all I wanted to do now is give back
so much to my community and workplace

423
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:41,605
because of how they treated me.

424
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:49,255
Do not think we need to focus just
on the processes and the outcomes.

425
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,705
Otherwise, the work you won't get done.

426
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:55,045
I, I promise you.

427
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,640
If you as a remote leader today,
if you create an environment that

428
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,450
respects and believes in humans, that
allows them to be okay with feeling

429
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,460
and being human, the work will get
done better than you had planned.

430
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,220
Thank you.

431
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,510
Cathy Tibbles: Thank you so much, Tom.

432
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,450
I had a whole bunch of questions.

433
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,740
All I was taking notes and then
you made me cry and then I'm really

434
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,530
glad that it was like a three
minute advertisement or sponsors.

435
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,910
How are you doing Misty?

436
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,460
Misty Combs: Very well.

437
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,930
Thank you.

438
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,360
Cathy Tibbles: Good Tom.

439
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,995
That was, um, amazing, I, I
feel like um, ok, I'm good.

440
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:48,205
Now.

441
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:52,765
ok bye, like, that was worth my 24 hour.

442
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:58,855
Like that's um, we just expanded
my team from like just me and two

443
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:01,915
friends that I've been working
with forever to seven of us.

444
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:08,365
And I feel like challenged to, to
do that and be the kind of place

445
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,215
where people can be themselves.

446
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:16,404
Tom Stinson: Yeah, it was, I think it's,
I think it's really powerful to, uh,

447
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,925
encourage everyone to be who they are
and to, to not have to be a different

448
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:26,005
person when they come online or step
into the office or wherever it is,

449
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:29,335
but, uh, to be validated and supported.

450
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:33,134
Cathy Tibbles: How often
have you given this message.

451
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,950
What is the response been?

452
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,360
Don't you get like, okay.

453
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,290
Millennial head, like,

454
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,020
Tom Stinson: uh, I mean, this
was the first time I've, I've

455
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,140
spoken at an event like this.

456
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,440
So, um, but this type of message.

457
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:55,000
I hope it's, it's a message that
I bring wherever I am and wherever

458
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,560
I interact with different people.

459
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:58,765
Yeah, I know that.

460
00:36:58,884 --> 00:36:59,095
Yeah.

461
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:02,425
With the whole millennial, you
know, we talk about our, our

462
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:05,725
feelings and things like that.

463
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:12,265
And I guess that's why I wanted to share
at the end that, um, it doesn't weaken

464
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:18,805
us or we can our teams by acknowledging
and supporting and, and, uh, raising

465
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,625
awareness of the emotional side of us.

466
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:23,515
And I, it, rather than.

467
00:37:24,415 --> 00:37:28,404
Creating an environment where people
are free to be who they are and,

468
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:30,355
uh, validated in how they are.

469
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:33,714
Uh, and that might change through
different seasons and different times.

470
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:36,325
Um, I think that strengthens it.

471
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:38,335
I truly do.

472
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:41,395
I think it just strengthens the team
and it strengthens that outcomes.

473
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:48,444
Um, where I, I mean, I know my,
my team a lot more now that I know

474
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:51,955
who they are, and I know how they
work in a better way because of.

475
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:53,740
Uh, more about them.

476
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,259
I know how I can encourage them.

477
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,549
I know how I can support them.

478
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:02,410
I know to how I, uh, I guess when looking
at them, I can see when they maybe

479
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,759
are stressed or how they are feeling
a moment and I can respond to that.

480
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,750
And I think it's just, you know, we
know that with our closest friends, you

481
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,100
know, we can see when, you know, uh, a
girlfriend or a boyfriend, uh, uh, not,

482
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,650
uh, not great and not in a great place.

483
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,109
And we, we can, we can be there for them.

484
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,320
Um, so I think, in work.

485
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:24,550
Yeah.

486
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,810
The home basis that we have.

487
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,630
Cathy Tibbles: Can you tell me
more about what that looks like?

488
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,240
Um, you zoom every night,
like is another meeting?

489
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:35,870
Tom Stinson: Yeah.

490
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,930
It's another meeting, another
meeting, which you'll love and hate.

491
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,650
Um, yeah, so we just create, um,
everyone that, uh, is in a home base.

492
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,160
They have essentially their own
slack channel, um, within our work.

493
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,250
And then they also can get to.

494
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:57,565
For about an hour a month, um, for on
a call and it's just a place to, to

495
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:01,985
connect so on slack, you know, often it's
sharing what they've been up to or, you

496
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:04,115
know, uh, cause we are remote company.

497
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:05,915
It's what our view is today.

498
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:10,235
Or if we're working from a different
location or going out, uh, walking

499
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:13,835
or, or seeing something, we just
sort of share these moments, um,

500
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:16,445
and interactions with these people.

501
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,100
Uh, on a, on a call it's, it's not
work-related, it's just a place to relax.

502
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,120
Maybe play a game together
or, or tell some stories or do

503
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,260
it some challenges together.

504
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,640
So just to, to build that connection
and to learn as I'm, as I mentioned, um,

505
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,010
uh, from, from different, uh, people's
different experiences and cultures.

506
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,950
So I I'm in Australia.

507
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,870
So one of my, the home-based Ironman,
um, also includes people throughout Asia.

508
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,819
Uh, so one of the greatest things
I had, uh, this last year was, was

509
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:54,950
really learning about how, uh, the
Wylie is celebrated in India, uh, and,

510
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,000
and the, the, the, what, what goes
on there and the meaning behind it.

511
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,109
And so it just sort of get a, a greater
depth of insight into the cultures

512
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,029
of the people who we work with.

513
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,950
And, uh, and I, I think that only string.

514
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:08,355
And helps us.

515
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:11,375
Cathy Tibbles: I think it's
really hard not to get lonely.

516
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:16,385
When you're a remote worker,
you work remote to Misty?

517
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:17,315
Misty Combs: I do.

518
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:21,185
I worked for a company
that has about 733 people.

519
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,805
Um, globally.

520
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:26,375
I believe we're in 34 countries
in 42 states in the United States.

521
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:29,255
We have had a lot of acquisitions.

522
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:31,325
Last few years.

523
00:40:31,325 --> 00:40:34,865
So you have different work
environments, work cultures, things

524
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,355
that organizations felt were important.

525
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:41,345
And it's really important to
be one company and connected.

526
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:46,295
So just as Tom was saying that the things
that make us unique as individuals aren't

527
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:48,545
necessarily our work-related skillset.

528
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:52,654
So we have looked for opportunities to
help people connect on more of a personal.

529
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:57,235
We do leverage slack for, um,
common interests, like people who,

530
00:40:57,275 --> 00:41:00,545
with a passion for photography
or cooking or their pets or.

531
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,530
And then we try to do things where
we really like to talk smack.

532
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,320
And we really like a bit of competition.

533
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,500
So online, um, card games, like, uh,
Euchre I'm from Michigan and, and

534
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,250
it's kind of a, uh, Michigan card
game that we are sharing that culture

535
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,380
with our friends around the world.

536
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,930
Um, we might have a couple of drinks.

537
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:30,770
Give each other a hard time while
we play cards or trivia, just

538
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,210
trying to build those relationships.

539
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,100
If you know somebody as a human being,
it's a lot easier to give them grace,

540
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,600
when something is going on at work.

541
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,710
Cathy Tibbles: I actually
just had a conversation this

542
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,810
week about how emotion like.

543
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:52,085
I want to just be more, I guess
it's my personality and firstborn.

544
00:41:52,085 --> 00:41:52,415
I don't know.

545
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:55,385
I would just want to like, get
it done, like just do the things.

546
00:41:55,385 --> 00:41:56,855
What's the emotion business.

547
00:41:56,885 --> 00:42:02,315
And, and, um, but she said, you know,
when you're emotional or vulnerable, when

548
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:08,045
somebody meets you there and is accepting
and loving, it has a far bigger impact.

549
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:13,925
Like we can like each other's little
personas easily, but when you're actually

550
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,085
real with somebody in our accepted.

551
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,085
That has an impact.

552
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:22,384
And I don't think we're going to
have much of a choice anyway, because

553
00:42:22,384 --> 00:42:23,795
millennials are taking over the world.

554
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:26,315
Tom Stinson: Yeah.

555
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:30,694
I think it's just about recognizing
that, that a huge part of us is that

556
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:35,795
we are emotional beings and, and,
and I think, and I'm not saying.

557
00:42:36,694 --> 00:42:40,654
We're the first generation to, to
catch onto this or anything like that.

558
00:42:40,984 --> 00:42:44,255
I think it's just about growing
and learning it as we move forward.

559
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:47,045
And rather than even, rather than
breaking it down into general,

560
00:42:47,075 --> 00:42:50,795
this is, uh, the definition of one
generation to another generation.

561
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:54,725
I think it's now just that we are
moving forward and we're becoming

562
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:59,015
more and more aware that, uh,
our emotions, uh, cannot be.

563
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,160
As we enter in the workplace,
that they are a part of, how are

564
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,330
we going to interact at work?

565
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,880
How, or what type of work we're
going to produce, but also the,

566
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,890
the type of person that we are.

567
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,470
Uh, so I mean, and, and I'm not saying
that everybody has to, or needs to

568
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,600
open up about everything and all the
deepest, darkest secrets, but I think

569
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,950
it's just having that, um, for the leader
to have, create that environment where

570
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,510
it's safe for people to be vulnerable.

571
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,560
And it's okay.

572
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,340
And it's not going to be
like responsibility for that.

573
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,340
That was a really good, yeah.

574
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,330
Yeah, definitely.

575
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:38,720
We got environment last.

576
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,830
Was that in that book?

577
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,170
I like, I believe so.

578
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,590
I get, I get lost between
all the different books and

579
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,570
podcasts or sessions I've seen.

580
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,180
Uh, but he's, he's a
fantastic voice, I think.

581
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,640
Cathy Tibbles: Do I get to keep talking?

582
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,600
When are we done?

583
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,470
Oh, you know what we have,
uh, we have a community.

584
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,195
In the next 10 minutes.

00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,615
